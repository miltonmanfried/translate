	New Year's yesterday first awkward/stormy, then nice. For petty reasons, clash with the now-testy \textit{Elsa}; she had not opened a bottle for the very idiotic Lilly "because of too much work", she gave me an unashamed, ungrateful answer. Brief Ã‰clat, she literally stopped work during the midday preparation and fled.
	Situation made more difficult by Jelski's visit. Lilli is very unpleasant, childish, not kind, dumb to the point of idiocy, rude, foul, coquettish. The day of her arrival Marta sent a receipt for the white veal, she was getting ill. I had to fetch Lilly at 4:30 from the station, and in the evening \?{the three of us picked the veal up after seeing Marta}{zogen wir zu dritt auf den Hirsch nach Marta sehen}, who was lying in her room, seriously ill.
