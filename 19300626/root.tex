Yeaterday: Telephone with the chief and Osaf. The chief wants me to turn out the little people here; but he has still not yet gone over to the big ones. That is so typically Hitler. In Plauen, still high in the saddle, today he again backed down. I have now negotiated with Buch and Kluge: in the morning, Mossakowski, Wauer and Herrmann will be shut out. Buch is today in Munich and is attempting to achieve the exclusion of Dr Str. Hitler wants me to come, but I think that is totally pointless, he makes promises and does not keep them. Yesterday I was totally kaputt from the eternal back and forth. Nothing...me more than indecisiveness. Gregor is very friendly with me. Chief tells me that he has completely separated himself from his brother. But I don't trust the shifty lower-Bavarian. \?{Activity}{Auﬂenetat} in the Reichstag. In leaden doldrums. The government crisis is at a high point. Nobody knows anymore whether it's out or in. Hindenburg...It could make you nauseous with the old sheep's head. Worked the whole evening at home. Today I will be ready with it. Soon the vacation starts.
