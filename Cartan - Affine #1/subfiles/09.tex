\subsection*{9}
We have supposed in the preceding that there is neither pressure nor tension. One gets back to the general case from the preceding case by agreeing to call the (generalized) momentum of the material element the vector whose components are obtained by adding respectively to the original components the quantities
\uequ{
-p_{xx}\,dy\,dz\,dt - p_{xy}\,dz\,dx\,dt - p_{xz}\,dx\,dy\,dt,\\
-p_{yx}\,dy\,dz\,dt - p_{yy}\,dz\,dx\,dt - p_{yz}\,dx\,dy\,dt,\\
-p_{zx}\,dy\,dz\,dt - p_{zy}\,dz\,dx\,dt - p_{zz}\,dx\,dy\,dt.
}

In the kinetic theory of gas, the pressure is effectively considered as a momentum flux due to the irregularity of the velocities of different molecules; the quantities designated earlier as $u,v,w$ only represent a \textit{mean} velocity.

One retrieves the classical equations of the mechanics of continuous media by developing (5), which gives
\uequ{
\pddX{\rho}{t} + \pddX{(\rho u)}{x} + \pddX{(\rho v)}{y} + \pddX{(\rho w)}{z} = 0,\\
\rho\left(\pddX{u}{t} + u\pddX{u}{x} + v\pddX{u}{y} + w\pddX{u}{z}\right) 
+ \pddX{p_{xx}}{x} + \pddX{p_{xy}}{y} + \pddX{p_{xz}}{z} = X,\\
\rho\left(\pddX{v}{t} + u\pddX{v}{x} + v\pddX{v}{y} + w\pddX{v}{z}\right) 
+ \pddX{p_{yx}}{x} + \pddX{p_{yy}}{y} + \pddX{p_{yz}}{z} = Y,\\
\rho\left(\pddX{w}{t} + u\pddX{w}{x} + v\pddX{w}{y} + w\pddX{w}{z}\right) 
+ \pddX{p_{zx}}{x} + \pddX{p_{zy}}{y} + \pddX{p_{zz}}{z} = Z.\\
