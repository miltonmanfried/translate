\subsection*{10}
These equations are not complete. This is in effect because we have not taken account of the \WTF{angular momentum theorem}{théorème des moments cinétiques}\footnote{It may be remarked that the analytic formulation of thus theorem does not necessarily presuppose rectangular axes.}; here it translates to the equalities
\uequ{
\int\int\int y\Pi_z - z\Pi_y = \int\int\int\int (yZ - zY)dt\,dx\,dy\,dz,\\
\int\int\int z\Pi_x - x\Pi_z = \int\int\int\int (zX - xZ)dt\,dx\,dy\,dz,\\
\int\int\int x\Pi_y - y\Pi_x = \int\int\int\int (xY - yX)dt\,dx\,dy\,dz;
}
the integrals of the second members are taken over an arbitrary four-dimensional domain, those of the first over the three-dimensional boundary of that domain. These equations give
\uequ{
[dy\,\Pi_z] - [dz\,\Pi_y] = 0,\\
[dz\,\Pi_x] - [dx\,\Pi_z] = 0,\\
[dx\,\Pi_y] - [dy\,\Pi_x] = 0;
}
these are identically satisfied if there is no pressure; in the general case they give
\uequ{
p_{zy} - p_{yz} = 0,\\
p_{xz} - p_{zx} = 0,\\
p_{yx} - p_{xy} = 0.
}
