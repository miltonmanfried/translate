\subsection*{12}
The sliding vector which has as its origin the world-point $\m$ which represents a given material point at a given instant, and which one obtains \?{by carrying from this point its} "mass-momentum", is expressed by
\uequ{
m\left[\m\,\frac{d\m}{dt}\right],
}
and the equatiob
\uequ{
\frac{d}{dt}\left\{
m\left[\m\,\frac{d\m}{dt}\right]
\right\} = [\F],
}
where $\F$ represents the sliding "force" vector, contains, at the same time as the fundamental principle of dynamics, the angular momentum theorem; it condenses into six equations
\uequ{
&\frac{dm}{dt} = 0.\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(m\frac{dx}{dt}\right) = X,\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(m\frac{dy}{dt}\right) = Y,\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(m\frac{dz}{dt}\right) = Z,\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(mt\frac{dx}{dt} - mx\right) = tX\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(mt\frac{dy}{dt} - my\right) = tY\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(mt\frac{dz}{dt} - mz\right) = tZ\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(my\frac{dz}{dt} - mz\frac{dy}{dt}\right) = yZ - zY,\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(mz\frac{dx}{dt} - mx\frac{dz}{dt}\right) = zX - xZ,\\
&\frac{d}{dt}\left(mx\frac{dy}{dt} - my\frac{dx}{dt}\right) = xY - yX.
