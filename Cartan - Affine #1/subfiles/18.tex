\subsection*{18}
We shall see later on how, following adopting the point of view of section 16 or 17, among all affine connections compatible with experience, there is one which is distinguished from the others by its intrinsic properties. We note however that one may imagine a mechanical theory in which the angular momentum of a material element with respect to a point on the interior of the element will not be infinitesimally small with respect to the momentum of the same element; one may also suppose that the state of tension of the medium is manifested by the \textit{couples} and not only the \textit{forces} acting on each plane element. In these conditions the analytic expression for $\G$ would contain the terms $[\e_0 \, \e_i]$ and $[\e_i \, \e_j]$, and thus \textit{the world affine connection would be \WTF{uniquely determined}{rel√®verait uniquement} by experience}; the mechanical facts would be compatible with just one definition of equivalence between tow Galilean systems with infinitesimally close origins.
