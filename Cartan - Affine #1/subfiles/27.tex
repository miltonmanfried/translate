\nc{\xa}{\mathbf{a}}

One may retrieve these formulae by a slightly different procedure, though one identical in substance. Consider a fixed point $\xa$; let $x^1, x^2, x^3$ be its coordinates with respect to a reference system attached to the point $\m$; we have
\uequ{
\xa = \m + x^1\e_1 + x^2\e_2 + x^3\e_3,
}
from which, differentiating and taking account of (1),
\uequ{
d\xa &= \left(dx^1 + \omega^1 + x^1\omega_1^1 + x^2\omega_2^1 + x^3 \omega_3^1\right)\e_1 \\
     &+ \left(dx^2 + \omega^2 + x^1\omega_1^2 + x^2\omega_2^2 + x^3 \omega_3^2\right)\e_2
      + \left(dx^3 + \omega^3 + x^1\omega_1^3 + x^2\omega_2^3 + x^3 \omega_3^3\right)\e_3.
}

The point $\xa$ being fixed, one thus has
\nequ{3}{
dx^1 + \omega^1 + x^1\omega_1^1 + x^2\omega_2^1 + x^3\omega_3^1 &= 0\\
dx^2 + \omega^2 + x^1\omega_1^2 + x^2\omega_2^2 + x^3\omega_3^2 &= 0\\
dx^3 + \omega^3 + x^1\omega_1^3 + x^2\omega_2^3 + x^3\omega_3^3 &= 0.
}

Expressing that the equations (3) are completely integrable, the structure equations (2) are recovered.
