Ultimately, to any infinitely-small closed contour starting at a point $\m$ and returning to it is associated an infinitely-small (to second order) affine displacement  whose components with respect to a reference system attached to the starting poi t $\m$ are the elements of the double integrals $\Omega^i, \Omega_i^j$. The first components $\Omega^i$ define a \textit{translation}, the others an (affine) \textit{rotation} around $\m$.

The translation is due to the \textit{torsion}, the rotation to the curvature of the given manifold.
