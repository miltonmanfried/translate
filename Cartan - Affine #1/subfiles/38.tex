\subsection*{38.}

In the preceding we have supposed that the manifold has three dimensions; but it is evident that the results obtained are valid for an arbitrary number of dimensions.

We have considered certain simple or multiple integrals whose element is a vector $d\m$ or $d\e_i$. More generally, we suppose that to each surface element of the manifold one may attach in an intrinsic manner a vector
\uequ{
\e_i \Pi^i;
}
this integral, extending over the infinitely-small closed surface, will be defined by \?{relating}{rapportant} each element of the integral to the affine space tangent to a point $\xa$ interior to the surface, which permits creating the sum of the different components\footnote{This is the same manner that, in chapter I, we have implicitly generalized the dynamical equations of continuous media for an arbitrary space-time affine connection.} In the same fashion it is shown above that the desired integral is equal to a volume integral whose element is
\uequ{
[d\e_i \Pi^i] + \e_i(\Pi^i)',
}
where $d\e_i$ is replaced by $\omega_i^k \cancel{d}e_k$. It would be the same if the $\Pi^i$ were the elements of triple or quadruple etc integrals, and if the integration was over a \textit{closed} manifold with 3, 4, ... dimensions.

One may also consider geometric forms of the second, third degree etc. A second degree form would be
\uequ{
[\m\e_i]\Pi^i + [\e_i \e_j] \Pi^{ij};
}
it would represent a system of (sliding) vectors. The exterior derivative of this form, which permits the reduction of an integral of $p+1$ dimensions to an integral over the form over a closed manifold with $p$ dimensions, would be
\uequ{[\m\e_1] \lbrace(\Pi^i) &+ [\omega_k^l \Pi^k]\rbrace \\
&+ [\e_i \e_j] \lbrace (\Pi^{ij}) + [\omega^i \Pi^j] - [\omega^j \Pi^i]
 + [\omega_k^l \Pi^{kj}] + [\omega_k^j \Pi^{ik}]\rbrace.
}
