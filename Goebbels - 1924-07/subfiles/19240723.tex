Thomas Mann "Royal Highness". Spiritual kitsch. Proud man, where have you gone. The old nobility is nourished with fresh blood via big industry. Naturally, the prince is idiotic and the American \WTF{Dollarmädchen} is an exceptionally intellectual little lady who studies mathematics and seeks to impress with precocious remarks. Many painfully awkward scenes. Mister Spoelman, the garment millionaire from America, \?{weary of money}{dollarmüde}, he comes to Europe \?{to do good deeds}{um Segen stiften}. Infatuation with the daughter (naturally the only one), everything as in a garden-variety novel. Miss Spoelmann runs into all kinds of bloodiness, meets an extremely stereotypical Jewish doctor, everything written so pro-domo, a defense of his own blood, which widely overshoots its mark, tendentious, awkwardly clear. Spirituality grates on the nerves, one feels pain over the case of the european writer Thomas Mann, who descended from the Buddenbrooks. Who will name Mann a racially pure artist? This man has no race, only civilization. No heartbeat. Cannot be heard. Tired flailing palaver, cheap wit. \WTF{So in dispute is not the world aristocracy. It is the nobility of the German nation.} No respect... literature. Thomas reaches his hand out to his brother Heinrich (\WTF{"Untertan"}), 


\WTF{I give up on this shit}
