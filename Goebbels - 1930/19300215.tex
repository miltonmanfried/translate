Yesterday's sensations: the Strasser newspapers are still carrying the appeals for the Berlin daily newspapers. That is an open break of discipline! I do nothing against it. Let Munich handle it -- it let it go kaputt. Wrote much and read tons of newspapers. It is swelling to an avalanche. Worked more at home. Started \?{Gesch.St.}{branch office} division B with Count Deyser as leader. \?{Hopefully that's it}{Hoffentlich gibt's was}. In the branch office I am \WTF{a spy on the trail}. \WTF{It can be dismissed only with caution}. Schemm speaks in the \WTF{Kr.V.Haus}. After that I also spoke briefly. Ate together with Schemm. He is a true idealist and \WTF{kann auch was}. One of the \WTF{...chenbaren} Bavarians. He is also very skeptical in his judgment of the Munich and Nuremberg clique. This Saturday. I enjoy myself on a free evening. Which I have needed. Already slept in once.
