The report just came: Horst Wessel has died early today. A new martyr for the Third Reich. Like his brother a wanderer between two worlds. I am full of pain and grief. I go immediately to the hospital. His poor, hopeless mother!
Yesterday: noon conference because of the daily paper. We have to wait. Der Angriff is glorious this time. \?{And it has been used as such}{Es hat also doch genutzt}. Afternoon and evening work at home. Much to read, much to write. And then music for a little while. I am totally lucky that I can be alone. Early to bed. Read "Buddenbrooks" until 2:00 in the morning. Despite everything a fabulous book. Shame about the man! Today much work, agitation, telephone and discussion. But how small that all is compared to a man sacrificing his life!
