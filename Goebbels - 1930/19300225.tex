Yesterday: Morning discussions about Wessel's funeral and Gau ceremony. The Gau is in mourning for 14 days. Probably funeral on Saturday. Hopefully the police allow it. Afternoon, Reichstag. Uninteresting. The Wirtschaft Party has sworn revenge upon us because of the Der Angriff against them. Which was also shameful for the party. Auwi, Kube, Epp and Goering conference over the Reichswehr. Groener is impossible. The Burogeneral "in slouch hat and with a peacock feather". That's how he looks to us. Office hours. Then \WTF{Sch. f.P.} Goering speaks excellently about "Flight as a political question". Gratifying to also see our worldview confirmed here. Afterwards together with Auwi, Kube, Goering and Lippert again. I hear \WTF{from the ring} that \WTF{we are beginning to be taken very seriously}{man heftig mit uns zu rechnen anfängt}. We have already shown them that. It is immediately apparent how the movement is moving forward. Today I drive to Magdeburg by car. To speak. Oh, this cold!
