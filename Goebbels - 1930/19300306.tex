Yesterday morning extension office work. Short and painless. Midday with Erika in the Rheingold. She was very nice and well. Talked with her about my relationship with women. \?{I need woman for balance}{Ich habe Frauen n√∂tig zum Ausgleich}. Especially on critical days they are a wondrous balm to me. But I must have the most varied characters about me. Erika was very understanding. At home, editorial work...Xenia made coffee and dawdled around. It was a quiet, productive afternoon. The good Xenia was so happy. Evening: Alexanderplatz evening discussion. I spoke well. Almost only workers. I then stood for a moment in the house where Horst Wessel was shot. Overflowed Bock brewery. Comradeship evening of the Wessel-stormers. \WTF{Wailing and drumbeats}{Tschingdara und Paukenkrach}. Soldierly words and manly honoring of the fallen Sturmfuehrer. I spoke only briefly. Auwi was also there. He is enjoying an increasing popularity among the people. Home tired.  Late. Worked until 2:00. No word from the chief. I let him be sullen.
