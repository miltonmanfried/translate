Yesterday midday with Princess Wied. She draws me. During which very nice conversation. She holds rather magnetic ideas. But otherwise she is really very likable. Also, the prince, who came afterwards and read a new "poem". To the Reichstag. Postponed decision to this afternoon. Hopefully it comes to a resolution. DVNP rescinds my immunity because of high treason. Excited scenes in the plenum. We don't mince words. Hugenberg is very awkward. Today I write a barbed essay against them. It would be right if we could now stamp out the Reichsausschuss. Discussion with two Reichswehr men, who expressed to me, on instructions of a great part of Bendlerstrasse, their sympathy about the essay against Groener. Sharp agitation reigns there. Office hours. \?{Difficult time}{Schwergebiet} with the section leader Friedenau, who I again patched things up with after a one-hour meeting. It makes one want to puke. Dr Wilms: interesting announcement. Town Representative: \WTF{Ich muss Treff auf die Finger schauen}. He wants to make a boss-ocracy out of the caucus. \WTF{Sch. f.P.} Renteler speaks extraordinarily about the [!] "soviet system". Today a day full of decisions. We are ready for battle. And in any case, we could only win.
