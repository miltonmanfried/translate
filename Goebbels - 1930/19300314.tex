Hindenburg has signed the Young Plan. With a decree to the German people. "Be united!" With that, the destiny of Germany is determined for the time being. We will unceasingly continue fighting, and from now on we have a new enemy: Hindenburg. Yesterday in the Reichstag, defense of the Republic. Severing speaks weakly. Continual \WTF{LÃ¤rmszenen}. On into the evening. \WTF{Dreher flies out}, and I am already asked to relinquish the floor after only 10 minutes. It is a true witches' cauldron. They want to smash us into the ground. But we defend ourselves with all means. Now the theater continues. The evening another quiet hour with Xenia. That is so essential for me.
