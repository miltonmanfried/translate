Yesterday: earnest debate with Lippert. Der Angriff must be better. He pays too little attention to it. It is \?{terrifying to him}{schrecklich bei ihm}, the fat bourgeois. \WTF{He has no demons of his own.} Much to read, much to write. Naturally no word from Munich. Afternoon, Reichstag. I give my speech to the finish over lots of noise. And hold up a mirror before Sozen and Severing, which they do not enjoy. Work at home. Essay, very sharp, about Hindenburg. Warrior union house speech. Overflowing, and spoke well. Sharp opinions against Hindenburg. Now Saturday. But much to do, so that there is probably no time left to relax.
