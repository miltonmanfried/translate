Yesterday with Wilke and Muchow an earnest discussion because of the newspaper question. The Strassers \?{begrudge us our success}{graben uns unsere Erfolge ab}. And Munich ties my hands. Hitler has in this matter alone already broken his word four times. I no longer believe him at all. He does not dare to proceed against Strasser. How will that be later, when he has to play dictator in Germany? Heavy heart after Goerlitz. Worn down, body and soul. I am tired of the bustle. Giant assembly. I speak almost three hours. A great success. The Goerlitzes are happy. Ate with some SA men in my "prince room". Then after three hours to bed dead tired. Up early. To Berlin! The government stepped down yesterday. Bruening is to form a bourgeois cabinet. Will the German Nationals fall? Right to the Reichstag. There I will learn details. This evening I speak in the "Neuen Welt". Together with Kaufmann. To crown it all, I have caught a cold. Outside it is a glorious Spring.
