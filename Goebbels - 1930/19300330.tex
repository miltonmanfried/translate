The Bruening cabinet is formed. From Dietrich up to Schiele. But SPD announces opposition and DNVP does not want to join. On Tuesday government statement. Perhaps the cabinet will just collapse. Then the dissolution of the Reichstag comes immediately. Bravo! Glorious times! Yesterday morning heaps of newspapers and lectures. Midday discussion with Gresing. He is a good chap! Comes from East Prussia, where I will go at the end of the week. Afternoon Angriff editing. It is splendit this time. Baptism with Wilke. How little these ceremonies are able to tell us. There until evening, ate, and pleased Wilke. He is happy in the morning. Sunday. Drove right to Greifswald. Much depression of the soul. All in pursuit of the stupid Munich group. The most difficult decisions stand before us. And Munich sleeps. It makes me want to puke! What is to become of that now?
