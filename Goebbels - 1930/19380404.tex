Yesterday: out here slept in and rested my voice. What a recuperation! Outside the Spring storm is raging. But in the house it is so cozy. Little walk through the forest. Otherwise work, music, lectures. The Vatican now takes back its statement from Friday. Had heard nothing about his statement previously. That is obviously a pure swindle. But at any rate he has gotten cold feet from the force of events. The fuehrer has had a grand success in Munich. 600,000 people on the streets. England has recognized the Anschluss of Austria. As expected. Realpolitik up against the Eden era. Stalin again recalled ambassadors to Moscow, among them Sarin. \WTF{Aber die kommen garnicht}. Also a state! Fuehrer directs a thank-you to the Austrian Legion. Who had also served him. Triumphal march into Vienna. Anhaltelager Willersdorf burnt down. A symbolic act! Franco moves forward powerfully. Almost to the Mediterranean. Reds in frightful distress. I have a lovely, comfortable day. In the evening early to bed. Today rested up and refreshed. Early again back to Berlin. Dalague has now completely \WTF{withdrawn his police newspaper}{seine Polizeizeitschrift ... eingezogen}. \WTF{I gave it life}{Ich habe ihn auf Draht gebracht}.He now sees his serious errors. Now we must only \WTF{break our chains}{auf die Kette springen}.
