Yesterday: now I am clear on the reorganization of German film: Jannings Ufa, Demandowski Tobis, Greven Terra, everything else remains. I don't want to change anything else there. One Wednesday I will make the proclamation. The preparations for the Viennese cultural institute are ready. Vienna must be generously subsidized by the Reich. \WTF{That alone doesn't provide it.} The German Volk provide around 850 million a year for the purposes of culture and entertainment. That would otherwise all be spent on food. So we must intensify our cultural work. My article against the intellectuals hits like a bomb. The whole press jumps on it. Thus an important question is clarified. \missing
