Yesterday: signed the contract with Lithuania. Conditions fixed. A qualified guarantee of borders. So a type of non-agression pact. In Memel, wild enthusiasm. The fuenrer enters with the fleet on the "Deutschland". The whole land breaks out in tears of joy. The agitation in the press in London and Paris continues, however no longer as strongly as before. I denounce the hypocrisy of the English in an essay "The morality of the rich". Our English news stations cause London much pain. There is much drivel about a Hitler-Stop-Front. But no one wants to \?{participate}{so recht mitmachen}. That will again become an English bankruptcy, as predicted. The empire has grown very old. \missing
