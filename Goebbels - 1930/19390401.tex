Yesterday: a glorious, sunny \WTF{attischer} Spring day. I am so happy. \missing. Visit \WTF{with the King}{beim KÃ¶nig}. He is better than I had thought. Clever, and with a very contagious hopefulness. I lay out the situation for him, explain above all our relationship to England, which especially interests him. He has proven himself as a sharp opponent of bolshevism. Whether peace shall remain? We hope so. In any case Germany does not want war, only its rights. I believe that I have dispelled some misconceptions. Trip through this glorious, \WTF{shining}{funky} Athens. \missing The Poles remain stubborn for now. Will Beck, who travelled right to London, let him be turned against Germany? I can hardly believe it. One gets so little news here, since there is no telephone. But if it burns, Hitler will call me right back. So, continue celebrating!
