The fuehrer has again been to a discussion with the Reich's president. There he has obtained the task of attempting to form a majority. \?{Also versteift sich die Gegenseite auf eine parlamentarische Lösung}{Thus the opposition solidifies around a parliamentary solution}. The parliamentary solution is however already for that reason impossible, since it is mixed up with presidential preconditions. While we discuss the character of this task, the people stood before the Kaiserhof and broke out into continuous chants of Heil to the fuehrer. The masses believe that Hitler has already been named Chancellor. What a frightful illusion! I succeeded only with effort to calm the people before the Kaiserhof and to direct them to move along. The discussions drag out the whole day. We must win time and remain hard. In the afternoon the fuehrer dictates his answer to the task. It comes down to the question of whether to attempt a presidential or parliamentary solution. This question first must be clarified before any more can be written. In a discussion with Dr Schacht I stood firm that he absolutely support our standpoint. He is one of the few who consistently stands out as a leader. Strasser makes the proposal to enter into negotiations with the Deutschnationals. The fuehrer calls off the strike. That will perhaps come later, but at the moment it is out of the question. Now a presidential solution needs to be attempted. Will the decision come down this time?
