The answer from Wilhelmstrasse to the fuehrer's 
letter has arrived. The conditions laid out there could not be fulfilled. A mixture of presidential and parliamentary \?{comsitions}{Vorbehalten} is impossible. The fuehrer will again give his answer in writing and turn down the task, since it cannot be carried out, but he will not fail to make clear new proposals. The fuehrer remains in all this tumult absolutely calm and strong. He has remarkable nerves. For relaxtion, we go in the evening to the theater and hear a wonderful masterpiece performance. The orchestra plays beautifully and captivates as never before. The eternal music of Wagner gives us all new strength and \?{resilience}{Spannstärke}. At the great "Wacht auf!" chorus \WTF{wird uns allen sehr weit ums Herz}.
