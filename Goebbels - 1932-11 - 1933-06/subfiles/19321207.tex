The Reichstag was in session the whole day. Caucus ans plenary sessions were held. Little speeches and votes, punctuated for a change by a bloody fracas in the foyer between a group of our members and communists. One of us was seriously injured. Still always considering the possibility here and there of getting into power in Prussia. I think that would be totally wrong. Either we must get all of the power or continue to carry out the sharpest opposition.
