Yesterday: Gau finance conference. Things are bad in the Gau. But we will get out of it yet. The whole afternoon doing Christmas gifts and letters. So many hundreds will be sent. Der Angriff is very handsome. But it is still never enough. Magda is great at Christmas. She is sweet. Worked more at home. Lectures and music. Council of elders. Plenary sitting cancelled. Another Council of elders right after Christmas. The decision against Schleicher must come soon. We must not acquiesce. I have written a sharp essay against Schleicher, "Program without Program". \WTF{Schim. Mein.} Today glorious sunshine. Everyone already in a Christmas mood.
