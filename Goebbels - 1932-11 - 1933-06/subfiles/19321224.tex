Yesterday: worked the whole day for Christmas. Packages, letters, gifts. I want to give a little joy to everyone. Hitler calls. Feder is supposed to be in Berlin conspiring with Schleicher. I investigate right away. Not true. Though he is in the Excelsior, but he only had a private matter. Niemann is still in contact with him and gets him on my behalf. Gau Christmas party on the great festival hall. Very festive. What upstanding people! Magda is also there. Singing and solos. I give a speech and thank the coworkers. How good they all are to us...gifts. They all bring much joy. Back home. Magda doesn't feel well. Bad pain. Stoeckel arrives and orders her immediate transfer to the clinic. So it is right, now everyone else has been cared for and given gifts, and so now my Christmas can begin.

Magda cried as she left. God grant that it isn't something bad. I am totally despairing. The year 1932 has been one streak of bad luck. It must be beaten into bits. I sit and ponder until late in the night. Everything is so empty and barren. If Magda is not there, then the house is like a ghost town. Fantastic sleep. Holy night. Harald comes. The poor little Bub also has no proper Christmas either. I will work, in order to overcome the desolation. Kubisch, Frl Stahl and Lippert, Hanke, everyone is on leave. Ach, rubbish, I will already be over there. Those are just sentimentalities. How many, who have no roof and no bed. Only head high and continue on.
