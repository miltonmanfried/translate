Yesterday: things are doing better with Magda, thank god. I spoke with Stoeckel on the phone, who calmed me down. Harald, Hitler and I write a nice letter to Magda. Dr Frau comes. The \?{Femefall}{lynching} in Dresden is causing us many problems. Infamous press agitation. Our papers are not at all on the high road. Money troubles in Munich. Afternoon, reading and writing. Hoffmann comes back. Full of wits and whimsy. In the evening Hitler read us his appeal. Sharp against the \?{defeatists}{Defaitisten}. No apology. Fight to the finish. Brushes off Strasser. So, totally our course! Hitler is terrific. Radical to the max. The only way to win. We have learned from 1918. No false cleverness to avoid danger. The bath here is good for Mutschmann. He was rather sickly. In the evening, clowning around and palaver. Hitler speaks about autarky. As always, very clever and original. He is a total power player. Wants no half measures. To bed.  Again had a good rest. That is the best recuperation. New year's eve today. We remain on the hills. The first new year together with Hitler. 1933 will be full of crises and struggles. And perhaps bring victory. God grant it!
