Yesterday: Mobilized the Gau. Meinshausen handles his affairs well. Finances with Brinkmann. Fellmer too weak. Central administration will be introduced. We must now economize and struggle. Everything put on a card. Talked through Wagnitz's funeral with Harpe. We want to bear this young tailor to his grave like a prince. Tomorrow evening 6:00, then protest in the Lustgarten. Prost, Herr Schleicher! To the clinic. Magda is very dejected. She thinks that she will never come home again. I comfort her and shore up her courage again. And the senseless anxiety starts again with me. Work at home. SA marches. 10000 at the Wittenbergplatz. Colorful sight. Stadium overflowing. Moving ceremony for Wagnitz. And then the reckoning with Schleicher. Hitler gets the power. No compromise. Stand firm! \WTF{Noch nie solche Stimmung.} So Strasser is excluded. Stormy ovation upon departure. \WTF{Wir biegen die Sache durch.}...I was in top form and spoke for two hours. Today: Hitler a sensation. Discussion with Papen in Cologne. \?{In their anxiety, the yellow press tells the most outrageous lies}{Die Journaille lügt in ihrer Angst das Blaue vom Him­ mel herunter}. Schelicher is worried. See "Tageliche Rundschau". Papen wants to topple Schleicher. Bravo! That would help us. Magda is doing better again. She is so darling.
