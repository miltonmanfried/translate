Yesterday: Waited. To Goering, where Hitler is. \WTF{Kurze Aus­sprache zu dreien.} Hamburg wobbles. Kaufmann insecure. Strasser. So he must go. Hitler is determined of it. Right to Lippe. Strasser will fight under the slogan: Against Goering and Goebbels. Prost. Hitler will speak with Papen in the evening. Am spent. I must go. Quickly to the clinic. Magda is sweet. She is doing better. In the train with Dr Klein- Dusseldorf. A pleasant man. I doctored him. Against Strasser. He understands. Auto trip to Hannover -- meeting. Spoke well, two times, in small dives. All meetings overflowing. Lippe is a success. In the evening late to Detmold. With Rust and Scheppmann and Auwi. Everyone against Strasser. To Vinsebeck. Glorious castle. Graf Metternich pleasant. Marvelous bedroom. \WTF{Ich penne aus.} Today: Haegert. Wiedemann. Talked through propaganda. Wiedemann in Franke's place. Good trade. Set forth guidelines. Haegert works well. Dr Ziegler and Saukel advised on popular education. I will also develop initiatives there. Franke has mucked everything up. Stupid guy! Coffee with the B...pleasant lady. Spoke twice. O torment! Magda is doing well. Hitler was with her today. He is very nice, and she has enjoyed herself immensely. This evening I met him. Wired from the conversation with Papen. Much accomplished today. Always on the move. But that keeps you young. Dr Ley is also there. Amusing type. Everyone against Strasser. He will be shocked when he rebels.
