Yesterday: last day in Lippe. Sat at \?{Kamin}{the fireplace}. Parley with Goering and Kerrl. Strasser to be vice chancellor in the cabinet. Traitor! The Prussian question must be tackled. Tomorrow, decision with Hitler. Lippe awaits. Schleicher has a conflict with the Landbund. The farmers go wild. Otherwise, nothing of importance. Everyone awaits results in Lippe. Great press agitation. Confusion in the evening. Farewell Vinsebeck. Dufficult. It was very nice. Things are good with Magda. I am so glad. Speech in...and another dive. Good, done. Out of Lippe. To Bielefeld. Bathed, ate. In the sleeping car. The Mamelucks ride with the car. Berlin. Desk full of work. Right into it again. Tomorrow Weimar. Gauleiter. Much is decided there. But first a few hours of sleep.
