Yesterday: Hanke held a lecture. With Hitler to the clinic. Magda is extremely happy. Food with Hitler. Politics. Schleicher doing badly. Gaining tine. Work at hone. Coffee at Kaiserhof. Hitler fantastic like always. To the clinic: held political course for the professors. They are all very nice. Magda up and about. With the chief again, "Rebel" film. Shaken up again. What a success! With Goering. Beautiful evening. Talked through tactics for the Council of Elders meeting. We must buy time. Then we will toss Schleicher. Hitler speaks sharply against Strasser. Goering has had a discussion with him this morning. He has become quite small. The good Gregor, the shrewd tactician!  \WTF{Komme es wie immer}, he will never again have power in his hands. Swapped recollections. Hitler very witty. We sit around together all night until 5:00. Three hours sleep. I am completely tired.
