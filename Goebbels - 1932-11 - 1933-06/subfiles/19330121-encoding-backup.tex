Yesterday: Morning at Dirksen's with von Gleichen. He made totally abstruse plans, \WTF{von wegen Oberrat} etc. That is literature indeed! Nothing at all comes out of these clowns. Bureau work. Prepared the stadium. Tomorrow Horst Wessel parade at Buelowplatz. The KPD is foaming at the mouth with rage. There will be an unholy mess. They want a ban. The government vacillates. Clinic. Magda is well again. Council of elders. ...Frick talks in circles. Now the plenum is to be held on Kan ðŸ‘Œ
