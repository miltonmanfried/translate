Yesterday: worked through the evening and then cleaned up. Slept in today. Hitler again there. Heavy decisions ahead. Today council of elders. Schleicher's position very shaky. Will he fall? The elder has the word. Sixteen degrees outside. Kaiser's birthday. Haha! Discussions the whole day. \?{I don't remember much of it}{Ich halte nicht viel davon}. Only not very optimistic about it. Keep your nerves! I feel fresh and ready for action. So, to work!
