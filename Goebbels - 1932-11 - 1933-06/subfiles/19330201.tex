Yesterday: Gau conferences. Talked through the new election campaign. Which will be totally huge. Maikowski should be buried like a king. Kaiserhof: discussed the Red Terror with Hitler. For now, still no countermeasures. First, let it burn. And four week's time for the electoral campaign. Negotiations with the Zentrum lead to naught. Rust is my placeholder in the Ministry of Culture. Clinic. Magda up. Today she comes home. How we all look forward to it! I have missed her so. Back home, much work. Then Kaiserhof. Hitler rams through the dissolution in the Kabinettsrat. Around 8:00 he comes. Ready. Today it is dissolved. But then to work. Still nothing yet undertaken against the press. We want to lull them into a false sense of security. We eat together and then sit in the hall for a long time. But Hitler looks bad. More sleep! We talk through the whole situation. Unity everywhere. Afterwards, the Prince and Princess Bismarck. They are very enthusiastic. The princess is a beautiful woman. To bed. Sleep is the main thing. Today Magda comes. How happy I am!
