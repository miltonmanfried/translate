Yesterday: Kaiserhof. Fetched Hitler. To the dome. Huge SA march. Moving ceremony for Maikowski and Schupo. Met the crown prince. \WTF{Nicht viel los!} Hitler flies to Munich. In torrential rain to the Invalids' Cemetary. Through endless rows of people. 600000 people at the embankment. State funeral. Schupo with us in a front. Clerics speak at the Invalids' Cemetary. Then I am on all German transmitters. In good form. Maikowski is up again. Goering speaks as minister. Unending procession. It rains. Gray on gray. Home. Reportage was, as I heard, very bad. Must not be transmitted. Kaiserhof discussion. Then radio at home. Will be State Secretary for Press and Propaganda. Not yet. I am to help with it. And Rust is Culture Minister. That's good. I am totally depressed. Hanke with an electoral exposé. Very bad. Must be worked on. Then home in the evening. Ello is there. Magda very sad. \?{I am up against a wall}{Man patscht mich an die Wand}. Hitler hardly helps. I have lost heart. Reaction is calling the shots. The third reich!
