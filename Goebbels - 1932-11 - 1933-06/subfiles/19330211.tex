Yesterday: Gau Reich Propaganda Conference. \WTF{Wir schaffen's schon}. Weidemann works well. Haegert too. Hanke however is reliable. Only money is lacking. To the stadium. Overflowing. \WTF{At ten places crowds of people}. 20 million listeners over the whole Reich. I am greeted jubilantly. First I brushed off the press. Then I spoke over all transmitters. Twenty minutes reportage.  It went splendidly. I no longer have any stagefright. Hitler comes. I report and then open. Hitler gives a fantastic speech. Totally against Marxism. At the end, great pathos. "Amen!" That was powerful and effective. All of Germany will go wild. Masses in mindless giddiness. And it is must remain. Together to Kaiserhof. Inquiries everywhere: fabulous effect. I eat with Hitler. He is very nice, but tired and exhausted. We talk with Werlin about cars. Noske dismissed. How small these little \?{twerps}{Knirpse} are. Still wanted \?{severance pay}{Umzugsgeld}. Home late. Chatted for a long time with Magda. Now she has the flu. Crying from impatience. I cannot sleep the whole night. Today again back to work. The press froths with rage. \?{So that was yesterday}{Also hat das gestern gesessen.}
