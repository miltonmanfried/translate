Deep snow outside. I see the start of the filming of the fuehrer's speech at the stadium. It went off very well. It will be indispensable to us as a propaganda weapon. Everywhere in the cities where the fuehrer cannot speak, this film must run. Above all it is effective because of the unity and representation of the relation between words and gestures. In the evening I speak again before the overflowing tennis hall. Now there is a true desire to hold rallies. One again has a structure, one has enthusiasm, drive and devotion to the cause, one has an audience that goes with them, one can speak as from the heart, and one does not need to coddle the opposition. We are raising a totally huge sum for the election, which will save us in a single blow from all money worries. I immediately alarm the whole propaganda apparatus and already an hour later the printing press is chugging along. Now we turn it up to top speed. If no more extraordinary breakdowns occur, then we have already won the whole \WTF{line}.
