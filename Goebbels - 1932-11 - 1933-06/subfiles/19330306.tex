Kaiserhof

Final clean-up work in the Gau. The parliamentary seats will be distributed and some financial questions are settled. All participants are in a wonderfully delighted mood. I draw up the balance sheet in an essay. The title is proud and self-aware: "The Volk want it!" Now the work goes wonderfully smoothly. Almost nowhere are there any more difficulties; what seemed to be insoluble even yesterday today resolves itself. In the afternoon in the Reich Chancellery I have the occasion to talk through the construction of my ministry with the fuehrer in a many-hour discussion. Now that the election has passed, we are so far along with it, and no more time can be lost. The ministry shall unify press, radio, film, theater and propaganda in a single, grand organization. The Reich Press Chief Funk is selected by me for the State Secretariat. I visit my house on Wilhelmplatz with him, where we take our meeting. It is a wonderful \WTF{Schinkelbau}, but in its furnishings it is so old and outdated that we will first have to rework it from top to bottom. In the evening, the old guard is assembled in the stadium. I speak to them from the heart, and all the brave party comrades, who have struggled alongside me for over six years now, are deeply touched that they have just witnessed the fulfillment of their dreams. In all of Germany, the crooked-cross flags flutter. The nation bears a new face.
