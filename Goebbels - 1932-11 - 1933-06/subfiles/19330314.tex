Kaiserhof

I am sworn in by the Reich President. It is a huge, solemn moment for me. What luck for us all that this old \WTF{ragenden} man still \?{knows about us}{über uns zu wissen}, and what a turn of fate that we are now going along with him. Now the construction in the ministry proceeds forward with a marvelous swiftness. All resistance is broken, only in the corners is there the hardly-audible whimpering of a dying bureaucracy.
