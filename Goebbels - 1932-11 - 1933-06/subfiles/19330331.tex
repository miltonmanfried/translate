Kaiserhof

Many people hang their heads and see ghosts. They think the boycott would lead to war. If we defend ourselves, we can only gain respect. We hold a final discussion in a little circle and decide that the boycott should begin at full strength tomorrow. It will be carried out for a day, and then a pause until Wednesday. If the foreign agitation ends, then it will be stopped, otherwise the knives come out. Now the German Jews \WTF{einwirken-shall have an effect} on their racial comrades in the world, so that they don't \?{get into trouble here}{ihnen hier...an den Kragen geht}. I give a statement concerning this before a press conference in breathless silence. Here the word goes around: the Jews have a \WTF{Jewish problem - Judenangst}. In the evening I speak to the officials in the tennis hall. The speech will be carried on all transmitters. I lay out the whole situation again as well as the necessity of enforcing the boycott \?{without exception}{fast unabwendbar}. And tomorrow the boycott begins.
