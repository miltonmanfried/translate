Kaiserhof

I am not often occupied with greeting foreigners coming to Berlin and giving them an explanation of the new Germany. They all come up here, laden with objections. Most go back converted. It is a great error by the opposition that they have so shamelessly lied about us to the world. In the long run they cannot stop them from coming into contact with us, and then the positive reaction is all the stronger. The Jews in Germany had done exactly the same thing earlier; with what success, that is now clear to all. Now they would do well to give up on Germany once and for all and not make a fuss about their worries. Since the more they speak about it, the more acute the Jewish question becomes, and when the world finally starts to deal with it, it will always be resolved against the Jews' interests. In the evening we are guests of the Reichswehr in Potsdam. I discuss many things with the young officers. They are extraordinarily knowledgable and eager to learn. The type of lieutenant that was known before the war no longer exists.
