Kaiserhof

The work immediately begins again. Everywhere, among the Volk there is talk of a second revolution which must come. That means nothing more than the first revolution is still not at an end.  We will soon have to set the reaction upon one another. The revolution must stop for nobody. My ministry is almost exclusively composed of young National Socialists. Though they don't understand the bureaucratic business as well as the old officials, they make up for it with fire, enthusiasm, and fresh idealism. May 1st is being handsomely prepared. We work on it like a \WTF{Generalstabsaufgabe}. The marching plan is ready. Difficulties only arose from the constrained \WTF{Anmarsch} possibilities. The demonstrations must unfold with precise punctuality. All eventualities must be pre-calculated and taken into account. A mistake could lead to catastrophe with the \?{masses}{Riesenmassen}, who we are trying to bring along. The fuehrer is staying in Munich.
