Yesterday: Chief's. Fought over the propaganda abroad. I have them. That was a piece of work. \WTF{Sharp in the affair}. Discussion with \WTF{Dem. ... and ... von ...} This makes a clever, energetic impression. He understands us. Only not economics...Angriff: going very well. Gau: going very well. At Hitler's. The whole ministry there. Labor congress. In the state council. All workers represented. Hitler speaks fantastically well. Spontaneous applause. Historic [!] hour. Labor puts its destiny in the fuehrer's hand. Everyone is moved and carried away. Workers return to the fatherland. Back home with Hitler. Introduced him to brother Hans, who is visiting. Long work still at home. Then late in the evening Opernplatz speech. Before the pyre of smutty and trashy books burned by students. I am in top form. Giant crowd. Home. To bed tired. Glorious Summer begins outside today.
