Yesterday: Nadolny was here. Unsympathetic and without style. \WTF{He wanted to wear us down - schlapp machen}. Hitler tore into him fearsomely. And I did afterwards. Conference with the propaganda division. Fischer Mu there. Discussed the campaign. Midday with the chief. Just back from Mu. Discussion with Blomberg. He is also \?{infected by Nadolny}{von Nadolny angesteckt}. \WTF{I laced him up in a corset}. \WTF{Name behalten.} Whoever gives in has lost. Blomberg then understands everything. Discussed a trip with Renzetti to Rome. Questioned Krukenberg very earnestly. I probably have to let him go. In the evening, comedy club. \WTF{"Da stimmt was nicht"}. The Jew Wallberg is crying. To Hitler's with Magda. Rosenberg there. Meager results from the London trip. He did not work out too well. Cold Baltic type! Geneva remains quiet. Everyone waits on the chief's speech tomorrow.
