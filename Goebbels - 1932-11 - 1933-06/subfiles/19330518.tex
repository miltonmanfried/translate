Yesterday: Ministry running. Krukenberg must go. Ältestenrat: SPD still playing coy. But they must agree. Old acquaintances greeted. All in agreement. \missing. Reichstag. Totally huge day. The fuehrer speaks. Fabulously skillful, witty, clear and without compromise. Storms of acclaim. A smash hit. Declaration of loyalty adopted by the whole house, incl SPD. Afterwards with the Fuehrer. Everyone is happy. I plead for a cleansing of the party. He grants me that. I make the preparations. It is high time. \WTF{Verkehrstagung} in my ministry. I speak briefly. Then others. Trouble with Krukenberg. With Dorpmueller to Essen. He holds a "lecture". Dying of laughter! Later with Papen. Chief and Goering there. Very amusing. We unearth old recollections. Alvensleben and the like. How distant that is all already. \WTF{Weltecho}{Worldwide response} to Hitler's speech fabulous. Relaxation. Hitler is a genius. And he is always right. And the \WTF{Bangemacher}{scaremongers} are a disgrace.
