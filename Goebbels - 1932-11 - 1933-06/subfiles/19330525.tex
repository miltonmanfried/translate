Yesterday: Visit from Dr Draeger, who came up with regards to the foreign propaganda. Rome trip ready. A \?{murderous schedule}{Mordsprogramm}. Ambassador von Dirksen. Told of Russia. \?{An enigma of the Volk}{Ein Rätsel von Volk}. Counseled Hitler midday. Mountains of work in the ministry. \WTF{Prang} in the Rheydt-M Gladbach affair. Bourgeois! Afternoon talk with the chief on external propaganda. Hitler defends my standpoint with verve. Neurath gives in. In this manner I hope to get to the edge. Talk with Goering. About gossip and trivialities. We shall unite again. \WTF{One must break out now and again}{Man muß sich hin und wieder mal ausklöhnen}[!]. The \?{couriers}{Zwischenträger} are the worst.
Evening: Rathaus receives Hitler. Totally huge and ostentatious. What memories in this house. How often I have been insulted here. And now we are triumphant. Afterwards to Hitler. Meissner with wife. Both are very nice. Amusing evening. He tells of Hindenburg. Who is a true monument. Late to bed. Slept in today.
