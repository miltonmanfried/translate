Dear Pauli!

Many thanks for your card, I've not come up with new arguments for the question at issue, but I must say that I find your manner of reasoning disagreeable, I mean: if at one point in time nature is in a state where ther are $\Delta m = 0$ $\pi$-components and $\Delta m = \pm 1$ $\sigma$-components, then they will also be $\Delta m = \pm 1$ right resp. left circular. But perhaps you're still right, we'll see. Incidentally, following your interpretation of Hanle splitting, for the strength of the oscillator for the green quicksilver line comes out to be about $\inv{30}$, which seems a bit unlikely to me.

You once argues against the quantization $W=\left(n+\inv{2}\right)h\nu + \beta\left(n+\inv{2}\right)^2$ in the band spectra; where are you with that? Further: were you in agreement with what I wrote in the last card about $\left(n+\inv{2}\right)h\nu$?

Many greetings,
Your W. Heisenberg
