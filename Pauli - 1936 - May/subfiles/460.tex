Very honorable Herr Kemmer!

Thans for the letter and manuscript. So far I am in agreement with it and today have sent it to the editors at Helvetica Physica Acta.

The precise interaction cross-section formula could possibly yet be of use to me, so please send them to me \WTF{at your convenience}{gelegentlich}.

As concerns your wider work, Wentzel is now keen to obtain the manuscript of your note on the Delbr\"uck effect.

To the question as to what you should should \?{further cross out}{weiter ixen}, we shall perhaps come back to that after Christmas. Just look at the new American papers on the nuclear forces in the Physical Review of the 1st of November more closely. The possibility discussed there that all non-electromagnetic nuclear forces should be independent of the charge (totally equal for proton-neutron and proton-proton) has a certain inner reason about it. \?{It could well be that it allows reasonable problems to be calculated}.

Are you staying in London for Christmas? In any case, have a good vacation and a happy new year. Greatings from Fierz as well.

Always your W. Pauli
