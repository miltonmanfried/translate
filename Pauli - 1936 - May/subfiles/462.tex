Dear Heisenberg!

Many thanks for your letter. What a shame that you aren't coming this time. After Christmas I want to more closely investigate my and Weisskopf's theory in the lattice world. What you write about fields of the type
\uequ{
\tau(r_{12})\frac{(\vsigma_1\vr_{12})(\vsigma_2 r_{12})}{r_{12}^2}\left[
\begin{matrix}
P_{12}\\
1
\end{matrix}
\right],
}
has also been meanwhile worked out by Fierz here. -- Also, Wentzel has recently said exactly the same thing regarding the pair-production according to the additional terms in the Fermi interaction; that this pair production is \textit{always} negligible compared to that by the internal conversion of $\gamma$-quanta.

Your information about the experimental work of Barn\'othy and Forr\'o interested me very much. Scherrer and I would be very interested in this paper (\sskip{...}). Could you send it some time please? \WTF{There is however some time}{Es hat aber gut Zeit} until after Christmas, and perhaps by then it will already have appeared.

So if you aren't coming now, we certainly hope that you come in the new year.

Wishin you a merry Christmas and a new years toast from my wife and

W. Pauli
