Dear Herr Jauch!

After reading the last letter from Lopes more closely, a great idea occured to me against the correctness of the operators he derived to take account of recoil. Namely, this operator is \textit{not} Hermitian! (That means that for his integral kernel $F$, $F(Q, Q') \neq F(Q', Q)$ because of the form of the denominator.) This seems to be mathematically nonsensical, since Hamiltonian operatora must always be Hermitian. Unfortunately it is assumed that this is not due to a simple arithmetical error, but rather to an inconsistency in the perturbation theory beivng utilized.


I recall that a similar difficulty was discussed by Hulme (Proceedings of the Royal Society) when he generalized the original MÃ¸ller method to inelastic collisions (with energy loss by radiation). (The difficulty does not occur with elastic collisions.) I would be very happy if you would write me with your opinion on this matter as soon as possible. \?{The whole calculation was there (and also your own from last year), but I don't have it here}. Hence at the moment I don't know \textit{how} to set the thing in order (merely symmetrizing the kernel $F$ with respect to $Q$ and $Q'$ is perhaps too simple).

Please tell Hu that I don't care that he signed the letter from Lopes, so long as he doesn't give his own contribution to this paper. 

Many greetings,

W. Pauli
