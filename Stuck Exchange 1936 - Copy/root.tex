\title{Stuck Exchange 1936}

\begin{document}

Abstract: The electron, neutrino, proton and neutron are considered as four different quantum states of the same particle. Quantum jumps between these states explain the $\beta$ decay (according to \textsc{Fermi}'s theory) and give the \textsc{Heisenberg-Majorana} neutron-proton exchange force besides. The determination, that negative electron and positive "particle" states (in contrast to "antiparticles"), prohibits the annihilation of heavy particles.
