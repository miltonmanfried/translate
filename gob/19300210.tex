Yesterday midday with Goering, Duerr and Koerner through a glorious sunny snowy day to Wannsee. Clears out the lungs. Afternoon to with Wessel in the hospital. It is going very badly. Has had a 39.5C fever and ate nothing for three days. He looks like a skeleton. I am very worried that we will lose him. I stood by his bed for two hours and spoke to him. Mentally he is still totally fresh. May god preserve him. Outside stood his mother waiting for me. The poor, unfortunate woman! To Fraulein Wiedemann. \?{Coffee}{Damenkaffee} with advice. The ladies want to organize a \?{cooperative}{Konsumorganisation}. I am very much in favor. We are already finished with the plan. Still consulting with Dr Conti about Wessel. Today he will see what is to be done. The boy must live. In the university "Wunder Asiens". Bad, poorly-directed film. Today consultation with Rosenberg. The newspapers are giving me many concerns.
