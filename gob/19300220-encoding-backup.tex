Again great conflict over the newspaper question. As I had predicted. The Strassers were with Hitler and have plucked the lyre of sentimentality. Has Hitler collapsed? I will know tomorrow; then, Hess just told me on the phone, I meet the chief in Nuremberg. I will try to provide clarity. Yesterday long discussion with Goering. He is totally on my side. Today Amann, Esser and Mueller come to Berlin. I will be very reserved. Yesterday afternoon more work at home. Wrote a sharp socialistic essay. Which is necessary since Dr Lippert wants to make a German-Volkish sheet out of Der Angriff. Yesterday afternoon earnest discussion about that with Duerr and Muchow, who completely shares my fears. Lippert was sick. I will give him a piece of my mind today. He is \missing and already gets a shudder if he had to write the word "shit". Gau day yesterday evening. All \WTF{Sef.} and \missing on top of that the \WTF{Saf}. Total unity reigns. It is essential that the political leadership and the SA recognize each other and converse. The previous evening was a start and satisfied me very much. Day before yesterday in the South was a great success. \WTF{Neuaufnahmen}. Things gradually going forwards. Only the wretched newspaper question. It steals so much of my mental strength. This evening I am invited to Frau von Dircksen's. The old lady is a fool for me, and soon the whole world will be converted. She has invited 16 people for me, among them the Goerings and August Wilhelm. Gah, I am tense. I am to be \?{put forth cloaked in freedom}{in Freiheit dressiert vorgef√ºhrt}, so to speak. Often I feel a paralysing \WTF{‹berdruﬂ}. Primarily, from the directionlessness and lack of leadership in Munich. God grant that they tuen things around there.
