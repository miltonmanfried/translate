The Reichstag adopted the Young plan with a large majority in the 2nd reading. The \WTF{...antrag}{...motion} only got a small majority. Hindenburg made the difference, who the Zentrum put under indecent pressure. Thus this question is also resolved. Hindenburg finally ad acta. The last decision comes this afternoon. For 60 years! I am totally sick from rage. Evening city council. Then wrote home. Late to the Goering meeting. Unfortunately poor attendance. Afterwards a big group at the Goerings' into the night. Many Swedes were there. Also Auwi. And a very intelligent police chief Eggebrecht, whole told me very interesting things about the police. Completely under Mann! Has thoroughly grasped the problem. How many supporters we already have among the police! Eggebrechr has made me many friends. I have a vague foreboding that something frightful is impending for us or me. Away with it! Maria has passed her Abitur. Thank god. Frau Goering is very good to me. I also like her very much. On to the work! The decision comes today!
