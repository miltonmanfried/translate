Yesterday: many conversations in the morning. Reichstag midday. Epp is there with Hanfstaengl.  We have an excited debate about socialism. Epp is very reactionary on social things. I sharply defended my standpoint. I don't take any nonsense. Plenum: endless \WTF{Plaetscherei}. The government crisis is at a high point. In the background, section 48 looms. The savior saves the Republic. Nausea. Evening with Xenia at the sound-film operetta: "Liebeswalzer". Very nice and merry. Has again refreshed me. Now to Goerlitz. The rush tears at my nerves. I enjoy myself on Easter.
