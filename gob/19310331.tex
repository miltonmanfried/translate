Yesterday work \?{under}{im Zeichen der} emergency order. We have to wait to see how the Prussian government handles it. Conferences with Gau and Angriff. Take care with the work! Careful that no unsuspected eruptions occur. Hindenburg has turned against the call to national opposition in a sharp declaration. He takes full responsibility for the emergency order. I never expected anything else. He is our enemy and must be treated as such. \?{The struggle would have been more helpful at the time in my trial}{Der Kampf hätte bes­ ser damals bei meinem Prozeß aufgenommen werden müssen}. I am writing a stockpile of essays. In order to have at least a couple days undisturbed Easter holiday. In the evening, office hours. Briefly discussed the situation with the district heads. Wait! But caution about the whole line. Discussion with Wetzel. SA causes me many worries. Stennes gives me no rest. That is the most difficult crisis that the party has to get through. A fine old, and yet young Herr. Totally with us. The famous Geiger is probably rather vain. But so are they all. At the FAG concert in the Clou. Many beautiful women. Afterwards talk with Bronnen. Now I am to speak in Dresden. \WTF{Verbot gefällig?}{Ban permitting?}
