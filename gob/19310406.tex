Berlin: Everything is going according to plan. Stennes took at most 200 men with him. I will clean house in any case. Yesterday morning conversation with Esser. He paints in the darkest colors. Spoke for Goering. Everywhere strong aversion against me. Stennes threatens, and my "friends" put up no resistance. I will go back to Berlin tomorrow evening and cut the Gordian knot. Hitler keeps faith in me. I will never forget that. Sat evening Karl Vallentin. Laughed some. He is a great comedian of the grotesque. Easter yesterday. The day together with Hitler. In the evening master singer. Have taken heart again. \WTF{Rode als Sachs}: a fabulous performance. Both the voice and the presentation. Afterwards another discussion with Hitler. About style and essence, culture and civilization. He has a clear head as well as a genius mind. Today we all drive to Tegernsee. I hope that I will again have Berlin back on track. again shortly. Then however I will be at my nerves' end. I am totally depressed. Great personal trials. But these too will have to be overcome. Or I'll end up under the wheels.
