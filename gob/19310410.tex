Much work yesterday. And 1000 \WTF{job postings}{Hiobposten}. I don't want to repeat it again: Stennes's tactic is to paint me as disloyal to Hitler, who he [!] wants to save from me. Bleh! The entire Jewish press naturally joins in. In the evening I have been so irritated that I again have a 40C fever. Frau von Dirksen comes at midnight and is touchingly concerned, like a mother. I love her very much. She also comforts me. Stennes comes with his new paper. "Workers, Farmers, Soldiers!" Poorly made. Muddled stupid rubbish! Now, where he must show action, he is a failure. A difficult, difficult night! I want to die!
