Friday was dreadful again. Report from Amann about der Angriff. Terrible, what havoc this Weissauer has wreaked. And yesterday he was with Frau von Dirksen, howled and pledged his devotion to me. Like a cow! Clash with Hinkel. Who stands completely by Amann, who naturally would like to take this opportunity to kill der Angriff. Now it shall only have eight pages and no longer appear in the provinces. I will fight. Endless telephone calls. Only Magda stays quiet. Wild press. Lies upon lies. It has become insane. Good Frau von Dirksen. She is like a mother to me. And that is now so necessary for me. \WTF{Mein Kopf rast.} In the evening I climb out of bed with a 40C fever drive to the Kurfurstendamm and speak before 2500 functionaries. Striking success. The political party is completely unbroken. Schulz is there too. Clever and nice. With whom I can manage. Hinkel gives in. He wants to visit me tomorrow. Fever returns. Dr Conti stayed with me for a long time. Stennes had \WTF{Generappell}. A flop, with 100 men. The Jewish press froths with rage. Only guard the nerves. It is 5:00 in the morning. I am still constantly down with a bad fever.
