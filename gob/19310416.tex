I am still not healthy. The poison of the sickness is still stuck inside me. I have difficult days and more difficult nights. Conference with Meinshausen. He asked for more trust. I will even give it to him. Long discussion with Schweitzer midday. Great worries about Munich. \WTF{Palaispartei.} If Stannes has been completely crushed, we must also deal with the causes which have lead to this revolt. In the party one must have the right to exemplarily deal with the guilty parties. Schweitzer is very skeptical. \WTF{I felt as if a hundred pages had would be dragged out of me}{Ich komme mir vor, als würde an hundert Seiten an mir herumgezerrt}. The role of the honest broker between Berlin and Munich is very difficult. Sick, tired, worn out. Work at home. Finished editing speech. That will be very nice. I wait in vain for Magda.  She telegraphs: staying another day in Dresden. Great disappointment. Worked until deep into the night with delirious pain. I am very dejected. Stennes publishes the second issue of his newspaper. Totally unskilled and so completely harmless. Big conference day today. Editorship will be brought into order. In the evening a general appeal to the SA in the Sportspalast. I will speak there. Outside a glorious Spring. \WTF{Now to be able to fly the coop in a couple weeks!}{Jetzt auf ein paar Wochen ausfliegen können!}
