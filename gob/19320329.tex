Dictated the whole afternoon. The fuehrer writes his manifesto. I design seven standard signs for the last week. The candidates for the Prussian Landtag are gathered together. In the evening I tell the fuehrer about November 1923. Then the party fell much further than this time. It all sounds like a riveting historical novel. Nevertheless we have again worked our way back up. It always comes back to how one takes a defeat. The fuehrer develops totally new ideas about our position towards women. Who are of preeminent importance for the next round of voting; since exactly this area we have been hard-hit in the first election. The woman is the sexual and working comrade of the man. She has always been and will always remain so. Even with the present economical relations she must be so. Formerly on the field, today in the bureau. Man is the organizer of life, woman is his help and his \?{instrument}{AusfuÌˆhrungsorgan}. This interpretation is modern and will lift us high above all the German Volkish resentments. We only get to bed at 5:00 in the morning.
