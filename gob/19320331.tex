Again in Berlin. Big propaganda conference. Our directives have already been implemented. The poet Hans Grimm publicly commits to the fuehrer. Seven university professors swear a similar commitment. Hugenberg publishes an article against us. It really has nothing to do with him. Press ban upon press ban. The government makes our large-scale newspaper action impossible. The electoral terror produces the wildest effects. But we struggle through. Groener publishes a final ban of our newspaper action. That is an open breach of the constitution. There is almost nothing left to us for the election now. These last days of March lie in a totally gray frog. That also very closely matches our mood. Soon the Easter peace is at an end. Then we push forward.
