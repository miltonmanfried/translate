The candidate lists for the Prussian Landtag are finished. We had some annoyances with them. It is difficult to find a proper middle path between the participation of the political organization and the SA. But with some good will it can be dealt with. I can imagine that in parliamentary parties this question often touches on the existence of existence of the whole organization. The propaganda division has gotten their last directives. The Jewish press publishes a false Kaiserhof-account of the fuehrer. It is impossible to induce the republican courts to defend our honor. The reaction is attacking us. We have to \?{hold out}{kurz treten} until April 10th. I obtain devastating private material about Severing. In a meeting with the fuehrer it is decided not to make this material public. \WTF{Was sind wir Wilde doch f√ºr bessere Menschen!} Our press has made some mistakes. Journalists are for the most part very ill-suited for propaganda. The ban on demonstrations has been lifted. So we will march in the Lustgarten. However our press action continues to be banned. That is a heavy blow to us. During a house search, awkward material about the Kurfuerstendamm trial was found. That goes back to a wild denunciation.  Thus one annoyance follows the other. But one can get through it with some patience. Going home in the evening, one is exhausted from worry and tension from work. We do not give up, come what may!
