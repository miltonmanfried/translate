\header{November 8th, 1932}

Yesterday: in the Gau, lousy mood. \WTF{I rang the Kr leader, SAF and BVG people}{Ich reppele auf. Kr.Leiter, S.A.F. und B.V.G.Leute}. Everything again ready to go. Hitler's appeal: keep struggling. Papen must go! The Scherl-preas article. Gigantic victory. We however were scoundrels. \WTF{Editorial line was given}{Redaktion Kurs angegeben}. It is already going! BVG strike abates. Hopeless. \WTF{Jumping off!}{Abspringen!} More work at home. Helldorf \?{brings news}{kommg berichten}. SA in good form. And much anger, want and drudgery. In thr evening, studies the press in the Gau. Our defeat everywhere. But no self-deception! To Munich. Conversed with Herr Schnee at length. A strange, mysterious person. \WTF{Full of underground and grotesqueries}{Voll von Untergr√ºnden und Grofeskheiten. But very sympathetic. Went with him to Munich, and Hitler will speak here. Arrived dead-tired. \WTF{Crashed}{Gepennt}. Waiting for Hitler. BVG strike broken off. Even the KPD collapsed. Lost! Much work today. My thoughts on the betrayal of the proletariat.
