\header{November 10th 1932 (Kaiserhof)}

Again in Berlin. The initial strong mood in the larty has now given way to a flat depression. Now troubles, strife and misunderstandings are popping up everywhere. It always happens like this: after the defeat, the trash bubbles to the top, and for a week or so it must be struggled with. \?{It is my understanding that}{Wie ich erfahre} Wilhelmstrasse is completely helpless. The situation is indeed so complicated that hardly any way out can be seen. If it continues this way, then the government is going to send the whole nation to tne dogs. The bourgeois press occupies itself with \?{speculation}{RÃ¤tselraten}. Tet the reasonable journalists are now gradually seeing that the situation is not so rosy for the reaction as they had predicted before the electoral battle. Now begins the great, probably last, mental trial. If we win, then we will come into power.
