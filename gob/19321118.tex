\header{November 18th 1932 (Kaiserhof)}

The fueherer arrived at Tempelhof at one o'clock. Frick and Strasser were with him. Goering is expected from Rome. He had great personal and political success there. The fuerher went home with us and I briefly filled him in on the situation. His conversation with the Reich President will perhaps have a decisive importance. If these two join hands, then the German revolution is secured. They must meet eye to eye and firmly trust one another. One conversation follows the other; but we will not let ourselves be put off. At midnight the fuehrer came back. We talked and played music. That is the only release after hard, nerve-rending battles. The government has extended the truce through January 2nd. With that, our planned propaganda campaign has for the time being fallen into the water. The fuehrer is very jovial. His only distrust is towards Strasser. We must watch out for him. The 13th of August must not be repeated. \?{Anything else, only not that}{Alles andere, nur das nicht}.
