\header{November 19th 1932 (Kaiserhof)}

Ths fuehrer went, cheered by masses of people, into Wilhelmstrasse to the Reich President. He had a one-and-a-half-hour discussion with him. He is again greeted with roaring cheers from the masses as he returns. He gave us a report on the course of the conversation. Result: remain firm and enter into no compromises. Wilhelmstrasse has two possibilities: either a new version of August 13th with the goal of making the cabinet unassailable as a caretaker cabinet, or an honest attempt to come to peace with the fuehrer ans the party. From the contradictory announcements that Wilhelmstrasse has been sending to us, no satisfactory conclusion can be drawn. For now it is still impossible to see clearly. The fuehrer developed his program with all deep, moral honesty and all responsibility with the Reich President. The conversation took place under four eyes. That was already a great advantage. The reports and rumors are tumbling forth. In the evening, the fuehrer was home with us. We keep our distance from all expedient optimism. If things go well, that is good, but if things go badly, then depression need not follow. I spoke until midnight with the SA leaders on a comradeship evening. All are stretched to the breaking point, as to how the dvelopment is to continue. The whole city stands in trembling agitation. I have 
he feeling that this time will still not come to the final decision.
