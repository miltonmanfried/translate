A Reich chancellor is sought! \?{One everyone thanks for taking up the last of the struggles against the NSDAP}{Ein jeder bedankt sich dafür, als letzter den Kampf gegen die N.S.D.A.P. aufzunehmen}. We drive with the fuehrer to Weimar. A glorious drive, with the wind blowing in our faces, and one can again breathe fresh air.
In the evening the fuehrer and I speak in the overflowing Weimar hall.  This time the mood in opposition to the August 13th affair is indescribably excited. If tjere is no break in the party itself, then we are certain to win the game. In the evening we stroll through this glorious city of Goethe and are totally ensnares in its indescribable magic. In the evening the fuehrer drives on to Munich and we turn back for Berlin.  Papen - Schleicher boxing match. Who will become chancellor? In the long view, a pointless question. Neither of the two. But we hold out until a more favorable situation returns.
