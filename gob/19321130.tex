After Weimar, back to the Thuringian electoral battle. In the evening, spoke in Eisenach and Apolda. In this election we must again prove ourselves for the first time. Late in the evening a telegram arrived from the fuehrer. He had been called to Berlin. But, he is not going there; he let General Schleicher wait and will come straight to Weimar in order to get a grip on the Thuringian election campaign. Now the negotiations are again over.
