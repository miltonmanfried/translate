General Schleicher has his cabinet ready. There is not a single outstanding character among them. I give this cabinet at most two months. I speak before the authorities in Karlshorst. An extraordinary mood again reigns here. The fuehrer has arrived in Berlin. We visit him at the Kaiserhof at midday. He has a discussion with Dr Schacht, who is as always on our side. In Thuringia we have again had losses in the election. We have also not entered into this action with total enthusiasm. Strasser for example has not really spoken at all. This defeat comes at a very inconvenient moment. There can be no election in the future in which we lose even one vote.
