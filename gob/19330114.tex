Yesterday: the whole day chatting at \?{Kamin}{the fireplace}. A visit from Northeim is coming. The little Sabine is all fire and \WTF{fat} for us. Hitler comes in the afternoon. He is fantastic again. Everyone enthusiastic. Two meetings in Detmold overflowing...with Schumann. He is terrific. He must be the Reich president! I am in top form. In the evening, late, to the fireplace, Goering cones. He is nice. Topic: Strasser. Who is in the process of betraying us to Schleicher. \WTF{Pfui Deubel!} But he will get his due. Late to bed. Magda was fever-free the whole day. Now...today: The papers bring the announcement that Strasser is to be named vice chancellor next week. A vulgar \WTF{Complott}. On Monday, Gauleiter in Weimar. The battle will commence there. Will be \?{a crucial}{die höchste} time. Today two more meetings. Then Berlin for a day. Lippe must be a success. We have done everything for that purpose.
