Yesterday: Gau conference. Esser only speaks rubbish. Wants money. Describes the hopeless situation with Streicher in Nuremberg. Streivher is plagued by delusions of grandeur. Editorial staff: discussed the chief. V.B. now joins in the dance. Laid out the \WTF{Kreisleiter}. Mood is glowing.

Walter Kasse: Finances improving. One must rigorously stay on top of them. Clinic: Magda not at her best. Temperature fluctuates. Only no reversal, that would be very dangerous. Lectures at home, press off the rails. Evening, doctors association. Overflowing. Hotel Atlas. I spoke well. Picked up the chief at Kaiserhof. He was together with Hugenberg. But without results. He wants a neutral cabinet. \WTF{Knif[!]}. Hitler has given him the word. With Dirksens: very nice. Princess Siegesmund colossally witty. Countess Konja very lovely. On the eternal Sunday I have made great...with Gleichen etc.  Yesterday Hitler was fantastic as always.
