Yesterday: Morning at Dirksen's with von Gleichen. He made totally abstruse plans, \WTF{von wegen Oberrat} etc. That is literature indeed! Nothing at all comes out of these clowns. Bureau work. Prepared the stadium. Tomorrow Horst Wessel parade at Buelowplatz. The KPD is foaming at the mouth with rage. There will be an unholy mess. They want a ban. The government vacillates. Clinic. Magda is well again. Council of elders. ...Frick talks in circles. Now the plenum is to be called on Jan 31st. Gained another week. Kaiserhof: Talked through the situation with Hitler. Sunday Buekowplatz, that is theater. Below for coffee. Great society. Work at home. Stadium overflowing with officials. A glorious scene. I spoke well and briefly. Loyalty, Hitler, party. Against Strasser. Hitler engulfed by an enthusiastic reception. Spoke fabulously. Sharply against Strasser: "Party defeatists break our back". Good! Unending ovations. Hitler is already a \WTF{Kerl}. Home. Palaver. \WTF{Hanfs}. Comes with two ladies. \WTF{Na, das war was}. Dreadful. Hitler remained until 3:00 in the morning. Slept in today. To work. Buelowplatz must be orderly. Will the police forbid it?
