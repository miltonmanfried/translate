Yesterday: Reichsadler work. Discussion with Ebner, Wagner and Raether. Advised about farmer's rally. Wagner is good. Raether's film idea still has many problems. Food with Hitler on the casino. He is very nice. Reochsadler: writing an essay against Schleicher: "General without a spine". Coffee with Hitler. He tells me the latest stance. On Sunday he was with Papen, Meissner and the young Hindenburg. Mapped out the terrain. The young Oskar a rare picture of doofiness. But one must not lose heart. All three sharply against Schleicher. Who must go. Papen wants to be vice-chancellor. That is all. Schleicher's position very precarious. He still does not seem to suspect anything. Poor naive child. Now he falls just as he brought the others to fall. He has earned that. Strasser is said to have run into the chief in Munich. But Schulz has put out that Hitler would have sought out this discussion, since Hitler had provisionally cancelled. Quite so! Schirach comes. His wife has gotten a little girl. What joy! To the casino with the chief and Hess. Debate over Strasser. I am very aggressive and Hitler agrees with me. Strasser is thoroughly amusing. A...The popular edition of his brothers. Only without ideas. Otherwise now totally harmless. Case closed. In the evening to Berlin. Hitler very nice to me. He says he is glad that he has me. I am very thankful to him. Much work on the train. Until 3 in the morning read and corrected. Berlin: Heaps of work and irritation. But I'll get through it. Magda is doing well. Hitler comes again in the morning. Poor Schleicher! Hopefully that ends well. He must go. Midday today to Gleiwitz and Beuthen.
