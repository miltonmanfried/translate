Yesterday: Electoral work at the bureau. Dr Meinshausen straightened out. Was necessary. Four dead in one day. Electioneering with Haegert. Kaiserhof. Hitler has the order for dissolution. New elections March 5th.  Against Marxism. We will win bigly. Hitler very kind. Magda comes out of the clinic. Still very pale. Hitler so good to her. Frau Raubal also there. At home, a homecoming party. I am so happy. Magda is my best. Rumors that I am to be Radio Commissar. Disgusting. I...am shoved into the corner. Work, much work. At 10:00 Hitler read a proclamation to the people over the radio. Very effective. Against November. Well done. Then he is with us. With Epp, Esser, Amann, Frau Raubal. Hanfst. plays. Gave a speech about Streicher. Who is impossible. Late to bed. Hard day today.
