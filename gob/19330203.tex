Yesterday: Readied campaign headquarters. This time there is hewing and stabbing. Goering with Gauleiter. I speak about electoral techniques and tactics. Good in form. Hitler comes and gives a wonderful speech. Of the tenacity on which our triumph is grounded. All are mute from enthusiasm. An uplifting rally for the faithful. Back home. Worked. Magda is very unhappy. Since I make no headway. I am passed over in an icy boycott. Now Rust gets the Ministry of Culture. I look up at the moon. That is so depressing. I don't want to think about it anymore. Short visit with the film. Somewhat refreshing. To Potsdam. Spoke before an overflowing hall. With Kerrl the Gauleiter. Mutschmann gives a great speech. Besotted. One of them even puked while Hitler was speaking. Prost. Hitler recounts his youth. Very warm. Home late. Magda still always crying. She is so good to me. Today a hard day if work.
