Yesterday: Niemann did some foolishness with money. Will try to stop him. Conferences. Most important is the Reich Propaganda one. It only lacks the money. Berlin cashbox in order. Goering cleans it up...is created. But bread as well? Troubles with electioneers. \?{Frick and Goering everywhere we turn}{Überall Frick und Göring uns vor die Nase}. Hitler calls a few times. I stay...Slogged away more at home. In the evening, on the radio, the Dresden-Tristan. The high point of music. Magda is already better. The sun is out. Hanke shares that there is no money to be expected for the electoral campaign. Then the fat Goering will have to do without caviar for once. Nauseating! But I repudiate the responsibility. So today I slow down on the work. So that I don't stall. \WTF{And National Socialism glides over all!}
