Kaiserhof

I write an effective poster against the KPD and SPD. Marxist papers no longer appear anywhere in the entire Reich. Goering has opened a grand campaign against the red parties in Prussia; it will end with their total annihilation. The cabinet has resolved on a very sharp directive against the KPD. This directive prescribes the death penalty. That is also essential. The Volk demand that now. There have been arrests upon arrests. Now the red pest shall be eradicated root and branch. The opposition does not show itself anywhere. The opposition seems to have been so astonished by our sudden and sharp measures that it no longer dares to fight back at all. I review the consequences of the arson in the Reichstag. The plenum offers a singular image of devastation. Debris atop debris. This will cost the KPD dearly. In the entire Volk there reigns an indescribable outrage over this cowardly Attentat. Now the work proceeds as if  under its own momentum. The worst is past. The hopefully last mishap has been happily overcome. Only a couple days yet and then we will be able to celebrate our triumph. There is again a lust for life.
