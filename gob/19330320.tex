Kaiserhof

In the cabinet the Enabling Law is accepted for four years. We have a report that will also accept in in the Zentrum. The cabinet decides on harsh punishment for provocateurs in uniform. That is all the more essential as heavy unrest is apparent absolutely everywhere, most of which is being hatched by such hostile elements.  In the end we must not shrink from the death penalty, since otherwise there is the danger that the revolution, which must continue unfalteringly, will be torn from the hands of the fuehrer. The fuehrer speaks before the Gauleiters and afterwards before the party members in the Reichstag and Landtag. One glorious moment, the whole plenum strewn with brownshirts. The fuehrer speaks in totally huge lines. We remain undeterred and don't give anything up. The revolution will continue to the end. The fuehrer has the same belief, internally and externally. The fuehrer does not surround himself with splendor and opulence, he appears in his own brownshirt, and he is on the inside just as what puts out on the outside. He doesn't speak any differently than he always has, just as unfaltering and uncompromising as before when we still weren't in power.
