Kaiserhof

I spoke with the fuehrer on the telephone: the call for boycott will be published today. Panic among the Jews! Klagges has banned the Stahlhelm in Braunschweig. There the reds have had another rendezvous. In the evening I speak before the film directors for the first time at Kaiserhof, and with great success develop a new program for the art of film. I am convinced that all participants will earnestly work with me. Film can only be healthy when it is again conscious of its Germanness and seeks its power in the German essence. In the evening I give the fuehrer a report on repercussions of the boycott appeal over the telephone. Like a thunderstorm, he has cleansed the atmosphere.
