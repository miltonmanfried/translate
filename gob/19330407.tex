In a six-hour cabinet meeting a series of drastic bills are adopted. They are as with regards to the Gleichschaltung, the \WTF{Reichsstatthalterschaften}, the administrative laws with the Aryan paragraphs, and finally May first is proclaimed a national holiday. \?{We are doing great work}{Wir machen ganze Arbeit}. On which our opponents will break their teeth, that will be passed here in a couple hours without any opposition. One could say that history is being made in Germany again. Out goal is an absolute \?{uniformization}{Vereinheitlichung} of the Reich. We are approaching this goal step by step. And so as the forging together of the Volk progresses, so does the concentration of our national willpower. At the end of this process, there is a united Volk in a united Reich. The foreign-exchange situation has, despite expectations, developed very favorably. The intended effect of Dr Schacht is now already completely unmistakable. A government must have luck. But in the long run it obviously only has that luck when it is competent; but a government that is exclusively pursued by bad luck can be of no use to the Volk. If our opposition were to accuse us today of having been lucky, then we can reply that it is always better for a nation to have a lucky government than an unlucky government.
