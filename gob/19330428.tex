Kaiserhof

I work all day on the technical execution of May 1st. It will be a masterwork of organization and mass demonstration. The cabinet adopts a \WTF{Dienststrafgesetz} for the SA. The party forces its way ever more forcefully with its organization into the state. We congregate in the Lustgarten and on the great Festplatz, the Tempelhofer field, a type of dress rehearsal for May 1st. \?{With good judgment}{Nach menschlichem Ermessen} everything will proceed precisely and smoothly. In Tempelhof gigantic structures have been built. It offers a grand picture of National Socialist \?{will}{Gestaltlungswillen}. May 1st will be a mass event like the world has never seen. The whole Volk will be united in one will and one readiness. In the first year of our revolution work will regain its honor, and labor will regain its recognition. A complicated mechanism will now be set in motion. Now our many-sided experience in the area of leading the masses will be of use. No movement but ours, \?{who understand how to lead the masses}{die Massen zu dirigieren versteht}, would be capable of a like mass demonstration.
