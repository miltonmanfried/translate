Yesterday: visits. Got the theater division ready with Laubinger and Dr Schloesser. Received Herrn von Raumer and von Maltzahn on questions of foreign propaganda. Everyone agrees with me, the propaganda belongs to me in toto. Midday with Hitler. He was with the old Herrn. \WTF{Statthalter durchgetzt!} Afternoon Leni Riefenstahl: she told of her plans. I proposed a Hitler film to her. She is enthusiastic about it. Evening with Magda and L Ruefenstahl in the Butterfly. It was well-sung and well-played. Afterwards we chatted in the \WTF{Traube}. Roosevelt directs an appeal to the world. Today Hitler spoke in the Reichstag. ...can still save Geneva. The main thing is, we keep our nerves. Minister if Defense has again been saved, thanks to me. Nadolny has driven him mad. Count Zech was with me. Envoy in the Hague. Thus is German foreign policy. The whole AA must be cleared out. But from the ground up.
