Yesterday: Spent Good Friday outside an Bogensee. Long and glorious sleep. Signed Rome-Belgrade pact. Peace and understanding about borders and economic questions. That was very important. With that, we have Yugoslavia in the group. Moscow will have little joy about that. Meanwhile, mutual recriminations in Rome and London. The English are momentarily doing goddamn-stupid politics. Run their mouths, pick fights, but they are too cowardly and too weak to negotiate. \?{Only a global empire could afford to do that}{Das kann sich nur ein Weltreich leisten}. But how long? Even the greatest reserves of strength and prestige can be used up. Eden is a rare idiot. The Vatican publishes an encyclical against bolshevism. Finally. And there the pope stresses the fight against Marxism. \WTF{He has done that once and for all}{Er habe das zuerst und am geschlossenÂ­sten gemacht}. The impudence of the highest, high and low clerics is actually unparalleled. It simply takes the breath away.
