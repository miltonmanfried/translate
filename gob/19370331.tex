Yesterday: started the work again. But bearable. The weather is wonderful. Spring is here! The impudence of the Vatican is still always a huge topic in the world press. Here, the church, freemasonry, Marxism, and Jewry work hand in hand. Against the cursed nazis. What noble company! Italy has \?{pulled back somewhat on the Spanish question}{in der Spanienfrage etwas zur√ºckgesteckt}. And London has also become more reasonable. We could only welcome that. Otherwise calm reigns in Spain. Civil war! Work with Hanke and Wedel. Above all, the film question. I work lovingly and carefully on that. It is very enjoyable. Hanke is familiarizing himself with that area which is foreign to him. Lectures in my consistently interesting China book. Afternoon took a little walk in lovely weather. Potsdam, Lenin, Schwanenwereer. Refreshing air, properly clears out the lungs. That does so much good! \missing
