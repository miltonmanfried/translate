Yesterday: early to work. Echoes from abroad of the fuehrer's speech are totally huge. ..provides "lasting peace". They cling to it. But they will see. If they give us our rights, yes. At the movies I see the new popular dances and see nothing there that must be forbidden. Only the squawking of English tubas...the nerves. Conversations because of the Salzburg festival. I told Dr Rainer my opinion openly. Then we come to an agreement. The ban against the cabaret is now up again. Terboven grumbles against Florian. Then he tells me in a very comradely manner about my private matters, but I cut that short. Great conversation about the reorganization of our film-week. Foundation of a new \WTf{central weekly newsreel}{Wochenschauzentrale}. I now take that in hand myself. We alone must put it right. Midday with the fuehrer. He will now drive to the mountain and think over his next measures in foreign policy. Perhaps it will come to the Czechs again. Since this problem is indeed only half-solved. But he is still not completely clear about it. Perhaps even the Ukraine. \missing
