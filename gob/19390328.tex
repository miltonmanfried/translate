Yesterday: still tons of work to catch up on. On top of that, the weather is very bad and a flight does not seem to be advisable. So we will go to the station in the evening. The fuehrer gives a final approval to the trip.  But I must always be reachable, so that in the case of emergency I can be called back. Poland is still causing great difficulties. The Poles are and naturally remain our enemies, even if they have, for their own reasons, served us many times in the past. I quickly take down a few essays from the bureaucracy which had been posted at our ministry. That must not be tolerated at all. Then quickly dictated a lead article, "Who wants war?" An unmasking of democracy. For now, I want to keep them on their heels. Franco begins his new offensive. Now he will probably bring a final closure to the Red horror. It has taken long enough. Mussolini's speech received with a sweet-and-sour mien in Paris and London. \WTF{They have no idea what to make of it.}{Man wei√ü so rechtes nichts damit anzufangen.} Paris is coy and in London they are grasping at the last straw. Miserable democracy, thine name is Cowardice!
