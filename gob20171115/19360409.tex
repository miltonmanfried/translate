Green Thursday: today moved to Schwanenwerder. Yesterday: slept a long time. Worked some. With Zeller and Wedel. Magda has had a phone call with the fuehrer. With the money, we are now clear. He is so touching. At home, however, all kinds of things to do. Afternoon took a ride. Finally landed in Schwanenwerder. It is already very lovely. Magda completely overworked. Wild commotion in Geneva. England and France are at loggerheads. Meanwhile however Mussolini \WTF{pours Negus on the soil}. Work at home. In the evening at a little theater "The Minister President". By Kurt Goetz. The piece is not worth much. Scandalous. \WTF{Aber wie die gespielt ist.} Jannings as...though the idea is too awkward. Otherwise glorious. And the Koppenhoefers as old countesses. Hartmann, Henckels and - Hilda Weissner. Wonderful! A great evening. Chatted a long time in the book club. Slept in today. Worked a bit more.  Then from 1:00 to Schwanenwerber. French answer there. A campaign speech. \WTF{Paragrapheng...!} Now I am in my own home. On the ocean. And restlessly happy. A refuge. Here I can rest and collect my strength.  Magda has arranged everything so gloriously. Cosy, clean, tasteful. And I feel so good here. First, inspected everything. Still was rearranged. And then I am there. At home. Easter starts now!
