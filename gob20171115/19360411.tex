Thursday: the whole day arranged, running around, enjoying myself, greeted the children, chatted with Magda. A glorious day! They are all so happy. Only I have lumbago, which is giving me pain and irritation. My room is wonderful! Magda has taken care of me so well. She is a true, dear helper. Read Hamsun. played music, loafed about, to bed early. Read a while longer and been completely happy. Though the bed is dreadful, what does that matter with so much joy and happiness. Friday: Good Friday! Slept in. Wandered around the house and garden. Afternoon many visits: Hommel, Dannhoff, Jannings and Kloepfers. Discussed Jannings' Bismarck project with him. The Kaiser must not be involved in it. He is now gradually seeing that. Discussed Kloepfer's Beethoven film with him. That is becoming an issue. He is made for it. The guests left in the evening. And we are alone again. Glorious, reading, playing music, stretched out, nothing to do! In Geneva, England-France quarrel against Germany-Italy. In the morning, Ambassador von Hoesch died. Now to find a proper successor. The zeppelin had motor trouble on the way home. But everything went well. Landed! Read Hamsun up in my room. Wonderful! Geneva postponed to mid-May! To bed early. Read until late in the night.  Today again such a wonderful day.
