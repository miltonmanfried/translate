\entry{January 3rd 1934}

Yesterday: Braun's house. Midday. Chatted with Bormann. He told of all kinds of news, of the Roehm/Hess affair, etc. Jokes. Munich air! In the hotel, extensive conversation with Fischer, Nippold and Schulze. \WTF{Rei.Prop.Leitung.} Now everything has been completely rearranged, the ministry precisely subdivided, modernized and made more impactful. "Wille und Weg" gets a chief editor. Nippold and Fischer \?{machen ihre Sache gut}{do their work well}.
Hotel. Sleep and lectures. Hamsun is good and skillful beyond all measure. The \?{..isch}{..-ish} storyteller. It must be said again and again: thus is man. No call from Hitler. I read and go early to bed, already at 10:00. How wonderful that is. I am totally free. Today, meetings: Epp, Siebert, Wagner, Esser. Tomorrow, Reichsleiter conference.
