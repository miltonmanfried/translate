\entry{June 4th 1938}

Yesterday: I slept wonderfully in the night. It is so still and peaceful here. And I feel so comfortable in my new building. Only, the weather, the weather! Like autumn! Magda is so joyful and happy that I feel comfortable here. The Berlin construction project will now begin at 12 locations on June 12th. The most grandiose construction project of all times. The fuehrer has won over the opposition. He is a genius! The Czech question again dominates public opinion. I poured yet more oil on the fire. \missing In the afternoon, talked through the jewish question with Helldorff. He still sees a vast number of difficulties. But we shall become the master. The goal of driving the Jews from Berlin. And truly without sentimentality. They have not been sentimental with us, either. Hellforff only needs to do what Isidor Weiss did, only with the sides reversed. It is decided. Well, let's wait and see! Sharper German protests in Prague against the latest advances. \!{Now that will probably gradually turn green and blue before the Czechs' eyes}{Jetzt wird's den Tschechen wohl allmählich grün und blau vor den Augen werden}. Speer has made known a grand plan for a redesign of the Grunewald. Again a long parley with Magda and Helldorff. \missing
