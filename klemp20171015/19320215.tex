Monday evening

On Friday 5.12 father was twenty years dead. â When I was so very tired coming out of college, with the usual pains in my throat and the way up to my ears, I am always rather certain that he will not have to wait long for me "on Sirius" â his favorite word.

Yesterday we had Wengler here, along with his rather \WTF{tolpatschige}, but good-natured and intelligent, sister. On top of that the Wieghardts, as usual. It has been going a little bit better with Eva lately. But always her inner emptiness —- nothing but economics and torpor. Only a depressing affection for the cats, which I cannot return. 

The Corneille column appeared in the NN on Sunday evening. The work on the monograph is slowly coming around. Very much distraction through colleagues, grading, meeting. I switch between indifference and bitterness with regards to the university.

Reading aloud: Treven, "The Death Ship". Much more declamatory and immature than The White Rose.

A certain awkward interest for politics. There is a new Hindenburg-Hitler election campaign. Some days I get promotional copies of the Deutschen Allgemein Zeitung. A Rightist, but good paper. As a rule I would like to read a big newspaper. Only the time and money is lacking.
