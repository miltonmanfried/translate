Thirsday morning, towards 7 o'clock

I again drove, as I am already accustomed, at 10:25 to Berlin. Difference: this time is \WTF{burnt}.

Yesterday afternoon in the bus to Hohendoelzschen got a view of the terrain  for a half hour. In Dember's immediate neighborhood. (Ds accompanied us). Eva was revived, was much fresher than before, and her feet are not so tired. I must get her the house, it may yet perhaps be her rescue. And if we \?{are to bear}{leben sollten} the high interest of 200M because of the two months. The matter of the money is now in progress, possible that it works out.
Eva is so entirely different than I. Much more life-weary, very apathetic towards death — and with many more plans for the future.

I wanted a couple days to finish with all the work. On Tuesday morning I sent off the Corneille manuscript; yesterday I began with the anthology. That is only \WTF{transcription} — but still \textit{something}. I first wanted to have the whole thing machine copied. That would have cost about 100M and still would have needed a great deal of copy-editing. on Wengler's advice I bought a Corneille issue as a printer's copy. Ten marks - but it only contains the half of the materials that I used. I have to write out the rest. I have spent about a month for the whole affair.
