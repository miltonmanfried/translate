... I now read French Englightenment exercises on Thurs in my room with five girls. Since I heard ... (that a teacher with a bigger class was dismissed I took my peculiar fate less badly. The philological department is apparently to be choked out.) Verybusy with \textit{Volk ohne Raum}. But I cannot find the time for notes. 
i started reading aloud from \textit{Guzman's "Eagle and Snake"}, about which I want to write for the DrNN.

\missing Yesterday in "Sing-Sing" with Gusti. Eva \WTF{told of} the main street of the quarter. At Gusti's it smells oppressively awful after the persistent and always futile spraying of \WTF{bug poison}. Luckily we could do a lot of sitting on the balcony. Peculiar, this \WTF{barracks region - Kasernengegend}.
I had just before leaving read of the fall of the war minister, of the "victory of the generals"; for the first time, the official army pops up in politics, and I now believe that we are deep into civil war. So I was more to the left and more friendly to Gusti's communism and Russophilia than otherwise. But one look at the poem against the overfed bourgeois again made me what I have long been: hopeless with both sides. There is no distinction between the crooked-cross and the soviets. Lacking intellectual freedom, merest intellectual decency. 
Incidentally it is now with politics as it is with the ego - pushed as much as possible on both sides.
