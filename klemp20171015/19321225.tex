Sunday evening.

The much-feared "holy night" — I fear it more each year — went well. Gusti Wieghardt (alone) with us, a good roast goose, 32 electric lamps on the christmas tree (16 the previous year) and Eva in a good mood . — But my heart is as heavy as ever, and I think that it is sick. — All day today (rainy weather after a period of frost) many notes o. the "Image of France". — In the last days, shopping with Eva in the city several times.

Read aloud from Stevenson, "The leaping lions"— completely delightful, deeply poetic in some places. \missing Traven: The trolley. Semper idem, in good and evil.
