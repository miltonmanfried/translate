\header{Thursday morning after 12, Leipzig. 21/XI.}

Even if I have nothing else to write, \?{I now always write at the desk}. It is warm and still there -- as long as the pedal piano behind me is silent. --

I fininished my notes on Cherbuliez "Reichgeworden" yesterday evening, then picked up Eva from the concert. We sat for quite some time with Frau Harms, Kratzert, Stettenheim, Kopke, Scherners at the Merkur. Eva read at length the notes Kopke gave her, which was again the red flag for me, and yesterday evening and this morning there were little jealousy-scenes over it. I torture Eva and myself, I blame myself -- I must get away. -- \missing
