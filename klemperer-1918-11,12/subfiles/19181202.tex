\header{Monday morning 2/December 18 Leipzig}

Astrée dominating and progressing.

Saturday after Merkur only one more evening game of "66" -- \WTF{there is nothing at all left of the reading aloud}{mit dem Vorlesen ist es gar nichts mehr}. \WTF{Sunday morning, as always, painful and wasted, since E hurried to the church}{Sonntag früh, wie immer, gekränkt und überflüssig, da E in die Kirche eilte}; then found equilibrium in work. I had absolutely no time to read aloud; it is good that E is so busy. Noon ate at home, afternoon in the Merkur with Scherners and Kopke and Stettenheim. We left at 5, worked here until 6:30 and then were picked up by Scherners. Ate together in Thür. Hof, went to Sch.'s, some music, then Harms and Kopke came for tea and abundant schnapps.

This morning is not helping my work. \WTF{I must "be billetted" at the Cloth hall}{Ich muß "Billet stehen" am Gewandhaus}; original intent was for us both; but I will nonetheless leave it for myself, from the various well-known reasons of vanishing time and money. Then to the school, because the new \WTF{tourist tickets}{Urlaubermarken} recently secured from the station; then to the university library as well. That will cost much time.
