\header{Sunday afternoon 22th XII 18 Leipzig}

Yesterday the \textit{Motette in the Thomas church} very nicely Christmaslike. Fine, old, simple things, things I understand. The church completely full above and below...For the second time in the Althoff's Christmas rush; bought a cooking pot for Frau Streller, and found nothing else for Scherner. Eva added to the vase a valuable leather bag which she does not use herself...I will give Eva a set of Bach's Canatas, \?{so that she doesn't end up totally empty-handed}{damit sie nicht ganz leer ausgeht}...an acquaintance from the Merkur provided us with \?{some candles}{einem Wachsst√∂ckchen}, and a tree can certainly be put up with ease.
