\header{Thursday evening towards 7 o'clock, 26/XII 18.}

Yesterday also went to Scherner's, was already with them at 5 in the afternoon. We brought potatoes and bacon, and \?{the four of us worked in the kitchen}{arbeiteten zu vieren in der KÃ¼che herum}. Kopke came after we ate, there was some music, and then the Harms appeared. It came out that we had been expected to be at the Harms's this evening, and a cooling could almost have arisen from such a misunderstanding. But then we sat and talked cheerfully around coffee and schnapps until after 1 and finally went home together. \missing
