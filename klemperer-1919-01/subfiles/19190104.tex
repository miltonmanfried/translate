\header{Saturday evening towards 1/2 8, 4 January 19}

Yesterday I got up at 7 o'clock and noticed for the first time the darkness of Winter. At 8 \?{the gas lock came on}{tritt Gassperre ein}, and only at 8:30 could anything be distinguished through the window. In between was breakfast...from 12-2 I sat in the small reading room of the library. I am constantly struggling with sleep, \?{always pulling myself together}{immer wieddf raffe ich mich}. Then in the afternoon between 4:30 and 7:30 lecture here again. I am on the 4th volume of Lotheissen, have read Rotrou's Saint Genest, leafed through Somaize's Dictionnaire des Précieuses, rummaged through the Tragiques with disappointment; they are too rhetorical for me. It is still questionable whether I will even succeed in preparing a half-dozen lecture-hours.

I accept the German chaos, especially in the East, as rather natural...even the "Simplicissimus" seems to be tired of the revolution. Yesterday two splendid images. "Liebknecht II" on a bayonet-\?{spiked}{gespickten} automobile: "I lead you towards marvellous times; whoever is against me will be smashed!" And \?{worn-out person}{Mühesam} on a red divan for manicures: "Manicure the callouses on my hands, I am now in the Workers' Council!"
