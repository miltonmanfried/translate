Yesterday evening at the Merkur with the Harmses. I told them that I had long yearned to be a political journalist and hadnever found a \?{way into newstands}{den Weg in Redactionen} myself. He thinks that I could perhaps write politics out of Munich for the Leipziger N.N. A possibility for the future! Harms is strongly prejudiced against the Democratic Party. Apparently personal feelings play a part: \WTF{they}{von der andern Seite her} had not forgiven him for going from the B.T. to the Leipziger N.N. He did so because he had different thoughts about the war than Th. Wolff and since he hoped to be able to bring the N.N. \?{over to his side}{sich her√ºberbringen}. Which succeeded, at least partially. Incidentally, Scherner says that in England the party is an "instrument" to the 
politicians, and no one blames them if they change the instrument of their plans halfway. But with us one speaks of lack of principle; and if a journalist goes to a differently-oriented paper, he is only asked how much more he gets there. He, Harms, doesn't deceive himself about his "noteriety".
