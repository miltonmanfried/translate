\header{Wednesday morning, 22nd of January 19.}

The day before yesterday, strike at the electrical works. Yesterday strike of the gas workers. So now the cafe is open, but one sits in the dark at home. We went once more to the Merkur at 5, where tye crowd was dangerous; at 6 I accompanied Eva to the conservatory, where this time Kopke and the Buckel couple were also in the audience. \?{They also have to help us out with food}{Dieses mu√üte uns mit Brod aushelfen}, since the baker as sold out, since the public fears a bakers' strike. That has not happened, and the two other strikes lasted only one day each -- nevertheless, living tgis way is infernal, and there is no possibility of an opportunity to work in peace.

Later in the evening, \textit{Harms} at the Merkur. We arranged that I was to report on political \?{matters}{Chiffre}, perhaps also university things, from Munich. Landtag, \?{guaranteed rights}{Reservatrechte}, Walchensee project. On Thursday afternoon I am also to discuss the matter with the editorial editor Mack.
