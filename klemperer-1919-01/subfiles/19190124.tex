\header{Friday morning. 24/I 18.}

The small world, \?{the awkwardness pf trying to hide something}{die Peinlichkeit etwas zu verbergen}. We sit a a table with a married Jewish couple. Discussion, Munich. The lady had to go to a Parthenkirchner sanatorium with her little daughter. I am to give information on the trip, \?{we exchange addresses - Liebmann}{wir wechseln Adressen - Liebmann}. The next day the man comes again to our table: was the \?{head staff physician}{Oberstabsarzt} my brother? "Then my brother, staff physician L, had fallen at his sode at Kowno in 1915...and your departed Herr Father had in Bromberg and Berlin wed my wife's siblings..." Now if the Scherners had been sitting here? To whom I had many times described by father as a philologist, and who suspect nothing of my Jewish origins?! --

After much back and forth, ww have arranged to have tea today \?{with my collegue Neubert}{beim Kollegen Neubert}, who lives on Fockstrasse in Connewitz. We still haven't met his wife. Incidentally, Vossler expressed himself very contemptuously about N. He describes himself as Jordan's student and \?{has never been to any of his, Vossler's, lectures}{habe bei ihm, Voßler, gar nicht gehört}; he had worked on Maupassant of all peoppe as a critic, while as a critic Maupassant was a nobody. --
