\header{Sunday afternoon 8/III.}

Eva is still constantly laid up sick, one day almost fever-free, the next with high fever and bad pains. Today an abcess forming on the jaw tortures her the most. Ritter brought in Stuttgen, who proved to be experienced. The day before yesterday she was so miserable from the pain that she had to get morphine. A small operation cannot be avoided. --

I am politically inactive since the strike overtook Leipzig. Hans M has officially joined the Spartakus Bund, "in order to fight against the unsavory elements and to serve the idea"; so one cannot be angry with him, he is like a child. "I have said to Levien: 'I cannot be a minister, I have been tainted by the profession of a \WTF{Schleichh√§ndler}{???}; \textit{you} cannot, you are a pimp!'". He was here in the morning; violent clashes and old friendship. Frequent political discussions with Dr Ritter, who is a moderate Centrum man. --

I was assigned a rate of 50M for the preparatory course today. Lucky, since Eva's sickness is costly. --

In the evening I read aloud from a \textit{Daudet} in German: "King in Exile". Remarkably timely, this dethroned prince.
