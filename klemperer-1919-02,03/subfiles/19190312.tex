Yesterday, Dr Ritter consulted a surgery professor. He sent, unashamedly, a young assistant, who handled Eva very roughly and caused her much pain. Same diagnosis as Dr Ritter: an abcess seems to have developed in the neck glands, we will have to wait. Eva has now already been laid up for 14 days. The fever is not very high, but constantly between 37.5 and 38.5, the pains are \?{increasingly}{Anfallweise} very violent. I am almost always with her and very cut off from my work. For the most part read aloud from the \?{plausible}{so glaubhaften} Daudet novel, "King in Exile". \missing \WTF{Today the Leipziger NN sent an article}{Heute schickten die Leipziger N.N. einen Artikel} \?{which appeared briefly before the general strike}{der gek√ºrzt noch vor dem Generalstreik erschien}. From the days after Eisner's murder. Everything later might be lost...In the morning, Elena Meyerhof was here, deafly and naively parroting back the opinions of her circle: For the new terribly bloody revolt in Berlin, Noske was again to blame and not Spartakus.
