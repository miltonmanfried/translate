\header{Sunday afternoon 5 o'clock. 13 April.}

Yesterday was lost. In the morning at the university, renewed clashes with Lerch, \WTF{who is trying to find a balance}{der einen Ausgleich herzustellen sucht}. He said that his sister-in-law "threatened" to further publicize my conversion \WTF{if I further cut her}{wenn ich sie...schnitt} like I did recently at Vossler's. I indignantly replied that in that case I would no longer consider her a lady, but rather I would \?{knock her down}{sie niederschlagen} if I see her again. Lerch was again helpless -- the feud grows "like an avalanche", and he can do nothing about it. In the afternoon I lost much time and good music with Eva and Seebass to the ridiculous \?{ready-for-the-stage}{b√ºhnenreife} lecturers' assembly. The senate was dismissed, the university closed, and Prof Maurenbrcher delivered an hour-long report on the results of the negotiations with the senate, according to which lecturers ar to have fixed places in the seminars and about similarly distressing questions! And that was seriously debated! I left the meeting at 6 with my stomach positively turning. -- \missing
