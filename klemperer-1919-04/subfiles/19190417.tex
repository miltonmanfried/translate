\header{Thursday morning 7 o'clock 17/IV.}

Today I put down the fantastic images of the revolution in a diary for Harms. -- My private activity these days was (1) finishing the Korff referat (until midday yesterday), (2) ardent reading aloud from the enthralling Zola. I didn't leave the house at all. The affair with the demented Rabinowitz tortures me further; she wants (bombardment with letters!) a \?{tribunal}{Schiedsgericht};  a type of \WTF{discussion of beliefs}{Glaubensgespräch}, where she may apparently treat with the "apostate and traitor". I have now left her an answer through Lerch; now I give up and wait. But the whole thing irks me. -- Program of work: today revolution diary for Harms, from tomorrow on, Corneille. \?{Out of the Romance language seminar I got the \textit{Steinweg} study on Corn., which Vossler and Lerch directed me to}{Auf dem roman. Seminar holte ich mir die Steinweg-Studien über Corn., auf die mich Vossler und Lerch hinwiesen}.
