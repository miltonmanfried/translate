\header{May 2nd Friday evening towards 1/2 8.}

The battle yesterday and today, \?{the fantastic camp life}{das tolle Lagerleben}, the heavy shooting until evening. Today I ventured out as far as Elena's place by the Pinakothek, as the grenades were going over the Pyramidenplatz; yesterday, as far as the Propylaen, \?{where the firing cracked over us all too clearly}{wohin das Feuer zu deutlich her√ºberkrachte}. I have described everything else faithfully in a third diary article for Harms, which I continually worked on today, though of course with many interruptions; I was always running again out onto the street, often together with Eva. Clash with Weckerle in front of Elena's door, then with Elena. The Noske people would murder here like they did in Berlin - \?{the ideas they fight for are not yet dead}{den Gedanken schlagen sie doch nicht tot}! We are not to blame for the deaths of the hostages, nor for the latter mismanagement! -- Good that Hans is in the hospital. -- Naturally, both days were lost for scientific work. Now everything seems to be essentially passed.
