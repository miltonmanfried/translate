\header{Saturday morninb 1/2 8. 3/May 19.}

Since yesterday evening there have only been a few shots (\?{three, mines four times}{drei, viermal Minen}) and now everything is completely calm. Of course the tram and post are still not running. Yesterday the rumor: Räterepublik in all of Germany...Government notice says: no White guards -- socialist government troops brpught you peace. The peopoe say: the Prussians. -- What \?{was fictitious}{fictiv war} in my article yesterday was the split into April 30th and May 2nd. Everything was written according to my notes yesterday, and so I \?{tailored my omissions}{mäßigte also meinen Ausfall} to the newspapers that spread horror stories, and included an indication of the murder of the hostages.

Read aloud a few pages of "La Terre". Plodding cultural history, undescribably repulsively vulgar. \WTF{Depending on where we are}{Stellenweis}, no longer possible to read out loud.
