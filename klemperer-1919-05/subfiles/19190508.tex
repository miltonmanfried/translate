\header{Thursday morning after 7 o'clock. 8/May 19.}

Visit with Lector Professor Hartmann. Old, harmless friendly people, the children have long been out of the house. The husband had never achieved anything scientific, had been habilitated an eternity ago, and has after years become a professor. Since his class-hours collided with mine, I promised to bring my lecture forward to 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Probably nothing at all will come of it...Yesterday evening with Hans M, who is back from the hospital, but is still hardly able to move. His house had been searched and (thanks to Behle) nothing was found. I can no longer enter his flat without a slight shudder. I told him about my article for the LNN and impressed upon him to emphasize my conservarism and to rely upon me.
