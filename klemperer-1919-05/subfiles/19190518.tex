\header{Sunday morning 18/May}

The "Schill" article (see journal entry from V.11) has been published as an editorial by the LNN on Wednesday evening, 5/14. But most characteristically: from the sentence "The troops fell into a rage and exercised military rule, \textit{even where a court martial did not allow death}, the subordinate clause is omitted. Nevertheless, my article is still sufficiently impartial. A few bad printing errors, \?{how "phrenetic"}{wie phrenetisch}, \?{Hausrecht}{Castle doctrine} instead of \?{Standrecht}{Martial law}. I was so happy about it being printed after the fate of the revolution diary that I mercilessly read it to Eva, who was dead-tired from many classes at the academt, then to Hans M, who I visited before supper, and then Heilbronn and Reyersbach, with whom we sat at Stephanie and who then came back with us. -- \missing
