\header{Wednesday evening after 7 o'clock. 21/5.}

Slow progress with the Burckhardt excerpt. -- Gave up reading Marchi aloud and yesterday began \textit{l'\OE uvre by Zola}...It has finally been determined that the semester will begin on June 16, \WTF{and I have signed up today}{ich habe heute angeschlagen}. Victor Hugo Mon Tues Thur 4-5, Lettres Pers. Wed 3-5. I have joined in case of a Munich emergency the reserve of the Epps regiment as "having been under fire thus not needing to be trained" (signed in the recruiting room at the university), and immediately regretted it. For whom did I enter? For the Munich philistines, for the Hoffmann government, for anti-semitism?? -- I feel especially bad today, old, sick and futureless. In the afternoon, in the catalogue room of the state library. A huge mass of \WTF{Petrarca literature}{???} was there. \?{How am I to work with that}{Wie soll ich das schaffen}? And it is only a fraction of the handbooks. -- Yesterday evening for tea at \textit{Borcherdt's}. There as well was my student Idler from the previous semester. Entertaining conversation...
