\header{Tuesday evening 11 o'clock June 3.}

Yesterday afternoon I got through the lecture. In the evening, Heilbronn and Reyersbach came -- attacking me however first politically from their radical position, so that we debated at length before I got to the reading. That then took an hour. Shortly before 11 the four of us then sat at Stephanie. Rothenbücher wrote me tat the lecture was to be held after the 16th of June. In the afternoon yesterday I immersed myself in the treasures of the \?{seminary library}{Seminarbibliothek}; for me that is always as instructive as it is depressing. There are far too many books and disciplines of which I have not the faintest idea about. --

Today, read from tge Légende des Siècles.

Yesterday Frau Muncker telephoned. We went to see her at noon today; in the afternoon Frau Rüderer came to see us. I will treat the complicated affair of the apartment offered to us at another time, when it has developed further. -- In the afternoon, \textit{Seebass} was here as well and played Beethoven and Mozart very beautifully together with Eva. In the evening Ritter sang with us; afterward he discussed medicine with us for a long time.
