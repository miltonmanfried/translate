In the catalog room Vossler told me, then Lerch himself told me, that Lerch was engaged and will be married \?{soon}{noch dieser Tage}. I had already heard that by Frau Muncker, since Lerch had applied for just that apartment; he had been turned away from there becwuse of his douteuse Frau. I naturally assumed that he wed the Rabinowitsch and told Frau Muncker my history. (She herself is a \WTF{baptized}{getaufte} Jew). Now I hear today that he did not marry the Rabinowitsch, but rather a Fraulein Herz, his and Vossler's student, gymnasium teacher, and doctoral student on a grammatical topic. What a mad fellow. But what depresses me most there: Now Vossler will help him, his grammatical helper, into the first professorship that becomes availavle. And I sit here, helpless. -- \missing
