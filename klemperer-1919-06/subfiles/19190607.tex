An approximate disposition of the Victor-Hugo lecture (two hours) is ready, started introductory lines. In the first hour I build out the question of the essence of Romanticism into a little \?{case study}{Sonderstudie}. Besides that, read yesterday and today KÃ¼chler's little book "French Romanticism", \?{which in individual articles, without digging too deep into this and that topic, nowhere offers a systematical approach}{as in Einzelartikeln, ohne tief zu greifen, dies und jenes zur Sache, nirgends aber einen Ansatz zur Systematik bietet}. -- \missing

Read aloud from L'\OE uvre. Nowhere does Zola seem to give so much personality. The wife, \WTF{who besides the work of her husband loses her right}{die neben dem Werk des Mannes ihr Recht verliert}, moved me very much. Eva said: \textit{You} are still not jealous? Perhaps a rhetorical question. I am befire anything else envious; I must always measure myself against her productivity and ability to work; it remains very bad for me.
