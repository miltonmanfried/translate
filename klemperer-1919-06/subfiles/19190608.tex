\header{Whit Sunday evening 8/June 19, towards 12 o'clock}

I completely suspended my work today. In the morning with Eva to a mass at the Hof church behind the castle, which we saw 7 years ago \?{covered in darkness}{dunkelverh√§ngt} during the death of the prince regent. Beautiful \WTF{gold-inlaid}{goldprunkende} wall and ceiling paintings. Enormous crowd of people. Music and ceremony boring. Toward noon to the city again, Eva got a ticket to the opera, which unfortunately ckst 11.30M. Concert in the Feldherrn hall, thousands of people. I found this place with the Theatiner church very pretty -- I am getting more and more used to Ludwigstrasse -- despite Eva's dislike. -- In the afternoon, correspondence. To \textit{Harms}, who I spilled put my heart to, to \textit{Grautoff}, the fat unsympathetic editor-in-chief of the Leipziger NN, who wrote very complimentarily to me and promised a 250M royalty, from which the unprinted "revolutionary diary" accounts for about 100M, which has unfortunately only been usable as informational material, which Harms has kept for me.

-- After supper in the moonlight, heat and darkness in the English garden went for a walk in the Hofgarten and back through Ludwigstrasse. Then to Stephanie. -- Read aloud much of \textit{L'\OE uvre}. Yesterday though much about the topic of "\textit{Romanticism}".
