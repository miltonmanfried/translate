\header{Wednesday evening June 11, towards 12 o'clock.}

Worked on the Hugo lecture the whole day; introduction "What is Romanticism?" Read a little Au Bonheur des Dames aloud, Nolhac for me. Towards evening in the Romance Language seminar, read Vossler's Italian history, \?{Looked everywhere for lexicons about}{in alkerhand Lexicis über...gesucht} Romance Languages, Romanesque, Romantique. The seminar buried me under all its books which I was supposed to, but didn't, know. I know less than every student, I can no longer close the gap. I even let Eva, who is already depressed-enough, suffer under it, since all of her attempts to earnestly play the piano always misfire (\WTF{since in the academy there is an even more impossible, more-authenticially-Bavarian business}{denn in der Akademie ist ein unmöglicher, echt bayerischer Betrieb}).
