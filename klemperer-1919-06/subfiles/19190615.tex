\header{Sunday morning 15/6}

Finished putting together the first two Hugo lectures (particularly "Romanticism") yesterday, in the afternoon took up Montesquieu. A case study. In between, a bit of Petrarca. Afterwards I finished the general first two Nolhac chapters, want to read the extensive biographical Koerting. For all its clumsiness, the introduction is better than I expected after the French novel in the 17th century. -- \WTF{It always seems senseless to me to be supposed to overview a book on November 1st that it is impossible to look over beforehand}{Immer sinnloser erscheint es mir, zum 1 November den Anfang, also gerade den Überblick eines Buches abliefern zu sollen, das ich unmöglich bis dahin überblikken kann}. Increasingly the whole work seems to me to be totally superficial and dishonest mechanical tasks. It is way too much for one individual to be able to do in such a short time; one can only \?{write verbatim summaries}{abschreiben}.

My mood sinks ever deeper. Without fulfillment from or respect for my own work, without hope for the future. And ever more lonesome. Eva lives her entire fulfilling life in music. That will not change, and my good years, \?{where my mental interests were the same as hers}{wo mein geistiges Interesse das ihre war}, will not return. Which is stated as a natural process, without reproach or apology. --
