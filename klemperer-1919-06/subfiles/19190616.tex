\header{Monday morning 16/6.}

All day Sunday I fanatically read \textit{Koerting's Petrarca} (much more comprehensible than I had imagined). Again \textit{no} Montesquieu. In the evening, \textit{Zola}. At Stephanie twice with Pontius, but only very briefly. Resolved to refrain from any professor visits because of an irrepressible aversion. --

\textit{Evening, towards 12 o'clock}. Worked on the Montesquieu. -- Case study. In the afternoon my first lecture: Hugo. Went quite good, with just as many attendees as the previous semester, unfortunately in a larger hall, where they can slip away. In the evening, the faithful KÃ¤ser came to see us. At the same time, after a telephone message, \textit{the Lerches}. She is a fine and modest person, not pretty, a bit of nervous twitching, not very young, but quite sympathetic. Swabian with a harsh accent. Is supposed to be \?{a Romance language scholar familiar with many languages}{vielsprachige Romanistin}. -- In the morning on the way to the dentist, did not go through the Hofgarten because of barbed wire. At many places in the city there are still barricades (long tangles of barbed wire, torn-up pavement). Everything was increased yesterday because of the city election, which brought a great victory for the Independents. --
