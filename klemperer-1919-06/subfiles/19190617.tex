How am I not supposed to be envious and depressed? The young Lerch, who shook off his marital unhappiness like it was nothing, who sat and worked here during the whole war, who published a prize-winning paper, whose questions Vossler compiles for him and whose prize Vossler so-to-say hands out, who works according to Vossler's intentions, is his particularly recognized student, who is now declared as the first \?{linguist}{Syntaktiker} of the new generation, whose works are his own philosophy -- the future tense! Modes! --, who is now married to a young \WTF{colleague}{Fachcollegin}, a Romance Linguist, oratio indirecta as a dissertation -- and who will with absolute death-like certainty fall into the furst free ordinairus (I made a bet with him in Greifswald). And I, late-thirties, derailed journalist, pityingly accepted as a philologist, since I am only a "more recent literary historian", without prospects for a post, the sixth unused wheel on the Munich Romance Language cart, in deep want of money, tired and mentally broken by the war...I could continue in this way at length. Even in matrimonial compatibility he is now ahread of me.q
