\header{Friday afternoon 27/June}

Slow advance in \WTF{Körtings Petrarka}. Very depressed hopeless mood. -- In my two classes, 30-32 people signed up for each; in Lerch's, some 80. -- Yesterday evening, before about 50 \?{upper-semester students}{hohen Semestern} a first talk in the action committee for university reform. Professor \textit{Aloys} Fischer on the general effort. He said nothing new. Should the university serve research or learning, should the private docents be paid, etc etc. And that the university would gradually become \?{trade school}{Beamtenschule}, and that it only \WTF{gave special sciences}{Specialwissenschaften gebe}, and that the peoples' leader would come from the economic life. It was all old and familiar to me. Next week or the following week I will speak there on France. I came back from the discussion at 9:30; there was a bit of music here. Homo novus: a \?{former}{gegangener} cavalry officer \textit{Schiffner}, who wants to become a farmer, much money and very good, not have a showy or daring appearance at all. His \WTF{heart}{Seelenpunkt} however was in horses and horse-sport; and his wife, who is ailing and not here, is in total agreement. That is \?{neither higher nor lower than}{nicht höher noch tiefer als} Romance philology, acrobatics or poetry. A slim thirty-something person with friendly brown eyes and a \?{rough-hewn}{zerhauenem} face; he was a student for a year before he became a rider. --
