\header{Sunday 29 June 19 after eating}

We have now been together for 15 years, and we want to celebrate the day in our own way. For the first time in many months we will visit a cinema, after that an expensive mocha in the new market, beforehand drinking our real coffee here at home. Eva shall also receive some sheet music as a gift, and due to Behle's hastiness (I only asked about the price, which he took for an order) have also obtained \?{the Pércopo and Wiese, but still not the Gaspari}{den Pércopo und Wiese bekommen, den Gaspari noch ausstehen}. -- I have also already read aloud much for the celebration. For that I got up at 6:45 and worked for two hours before breakfast on the Hugo lecture. My workday yesterday also went to that. Now I am almost again covered for this week. --

Yesterday afternoon (I was at home alone) a condolence visit from \textit{Vossler} and his wife. He did not in any way contradict my suspicion that Lerch would come to Greifswald, but encouraged me forcefully to hold off. I would still have to carry on for a couple more years, then I would certainly get a lectern. He said "a couple of years" so easily.
