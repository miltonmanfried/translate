\header{Monday after 10:30 in the evening. 14 July 19}

I am again very lonely and wretched. I often think that I would not have left Eva so alone as she has left me. But I did encourage her to travel, and she felt poorly here. Today, three picture postcards from her arrived: from Warburg, where her trip was interrupted for a few hours on Thursday, and from Driburg, where she finally arrived on Thursday evening at 9, after having been on the way since noon Wednesday. However she seems to be good snd to have travelled in comfort. Of course, it was also very expensive. There also arrived today a wretched pencilled letter from her mother. She has one lame arm, she is now entirely helpless, does not want to go to a hospital (since they do not give enough morphine there), and will probably die soon. To put it in the old way, god forgive me, it would be best on all sides if she would do it, but she will certainly still live for many years and probablt longer than I. I sent her 50M, less for her than for myself. \missing
