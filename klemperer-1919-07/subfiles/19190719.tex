\missing

I have again had the worst work-day today. I wearily \?{work}{buchstabiere ich mich} through a few pages of Petrarca, read a few pages of Morf's overview and Vossler's habilitationsschrift. Time stands still, I am tired and feel useless.

\missing I scan the evening mail, according to which I had a letter from Eva from the 15th and 16th. If only her knee were better. And if I was only with her again. The loneliness is overwhelming me. I will write to her now, then a few notes on the Petr. letters. --
