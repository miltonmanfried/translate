Dear Herr Land\'e!

I have just sent off my paper, and it it I have taken into account all of the wishes of Herrn Back that you shared with me in your card from the 12th. After the theoretical calculations and results on the paper published by Grotrian I wrote: "The previously unpublished measurements of the Zeeman effect \WTF{einiger Bleilinien} by E \textit{Back} make it further very likely that the first-named four $p$-terms get the $j$-values $(2,2,1,0)$ and that the $g$-values of these terms are in agreement with the theoretically-expected values.*"

Footnote to this *: "These results were made possible by the cooperation of Herrn Black, who in the most friendly way permitted me to view his measurements even before they were published. For this I would like here to express my thanks to him. Herr \textit{Back}
