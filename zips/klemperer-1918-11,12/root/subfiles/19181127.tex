\header{Wednesday evening, towards 8:00 27/Nov. 18. Leipzig.}

Yesterday evening at Scherner's. Grieg was there, real coffee, for Eva pharmacist-strength codeine as well.

This morning went to Becker's seminar, which is held in the beautiful Ladies' High School since the \?{university is out of coal}{ohne Kohlen ist}. He explained a few lines of Aucassin et Nicolette primarily by phonetically deriving out the individual words letter by letter. I think I could do that too \WTF{if I went over Schwan-Behrens for 4 weeks and then prepared for each seminar}{wenn ich einmal 4 Wochen Schwan-Behrens repetiere und mich dann auf jede Seminarstunde vorbereite}. It isn't sorcery. \missing
