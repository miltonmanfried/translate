\header{Saturday afternoon 30/Nov. 18.}

We live totally peacefully and \?{smoothly}{gleichmäßig}; is is strange for us to read of "revolution", the controversy over the red flag at the university seems childish to us, everything here is \?{bathed in the most peaceful normalcy}{in völligen friedlichsten Alltag getaucht}. And yet from the newspapers it appears that chaos is increasing everywhere, and yet it is possible, yea probable, that we will soon have civil war and all possible abominations here as in the whole of Germany. It is with this revolution as with the "emptiness of the battlefields". \?{The majority happens underground; at least one knows and sees who stands in the middle}{Das meist geht unterirdisch vor sich; am wenigsten weiß und sieht, wer mitteninne steht}. --

Yesteday evening we got home early. Eva \WTF{put down a chorale prelude}{Eva setzte sich ein Choralvorspiel}, I went to my Astrée notes. \WTF{Wistful division of labor}{wehmütig Arbeitstrennung}. Only later a game of 66.

I met Dr. Neubert in the Merkur, who has meanwhile married and taken up his lectures here.
