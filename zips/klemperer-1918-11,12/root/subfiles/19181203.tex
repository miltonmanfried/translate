Yesterday it became very clear to us that we must go to Munich very shortly in order to seek an apartment there, be it in January, be it in April. The difficulties are becoming extraordinarily large. I cannot imagine the financial future at all. I keep hoping for a miracle to save us, and am living from hand to mouth.

Yesterday evening in the Merkur, sat for a long time with \textit{Kratzert}. He is a military head pharmacist and \?{has an office here}{ist...hier im Amt}; he requested his monthly salary over the telephone, and the soldiers' council informed him that he was fired. Likewise Felix wrote me today in a nice letter, which regards the present situation with sad resignation, he was informed of his dismissal in an informal letter.

It is very strange with how dully I regard the course of things, Astr√©e is more important to me.
