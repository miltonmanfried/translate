\header{Tbursday afternoon, 6 O'clock. Leipzig 19th XII 18.}

As much Astrée as possible. -- Very strong chill. -- Very strong \?{depression because of monetary issues}{Depression der Gelddinge halber}, and since I no longer believe in my mental productivity. Jule Sebba, who I had rather openly begged some weeks ago, offered me 3000M in a touching friendly letter today. \?{It was the money that I had given back to him in Ghent}{Es seien die Gelder, die ich ihm in Hinblick auf Gent zurückgegeben}, and "cessante causa cessat effectus", it was also very advantageous to his taxes when he shoved the money on to me...I will probably take it, but with heavy heart. The romantic lies of before -- "\?{You'll soon pay it back in your own way}{Du gibst es bald aus Eigenem zurück}" and "You are doing important things", "\?{You must be the chosen one}{Du darfst als Auswählter}" -- are so completely behind past; I feel like a failure.
