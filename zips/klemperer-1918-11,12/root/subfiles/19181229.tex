\?{\textit{Lotheissen}, whenever I am up to it, i.e. a few hours a day.}{Lotheissen, sooft ich Frische finde, d.h. wenige Studen am Tage}. I fall asleep in the middle of the lecture. I am often very doubtful, I don't see how I can bring a halfway-passable course to fruition, I don't see what shall become of me when I fail there. I am tortured most bitterly by that, and also torture Eva. \missing
