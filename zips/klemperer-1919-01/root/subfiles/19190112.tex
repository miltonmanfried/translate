\header{Sunday morning January 12th 19}

Much cafe, little work. Leafed through Malherbe, finished reading Racine's Iphigenie, began Bajazet. --

For the first time in years, wrote a little article: "\?{Towards the new language of poetrt}{Zur neuesten Dichtersprache}", comparing the \?{activists}{Aktionsleute} with the Praecieuses. In autumn of 1916 I wrote an article for the B.T. on the German library and the Paderboen library, since then nothing more, for years nothing... I would like to be a political journalist; but I would not be satisfied \WTF{getting bogged down in journalistic busy work}{feuilletonistischen Verzettlungen}.

The heavy battles in Berlin are naturally creating a sensation in the newspapers.

This afternoon and evening again together with Scherner. --
