\header{Thursday evening towards 8 o'clock 16/I 19}

Yesterday I met Frau Harms at the con., and after eating and a quick cup of coffee at the Merkur we with Harms (alone) until midnight having tea. I spoke quite openly about my private \?{relationships}{Verh채ltnissen} and afterwards gave the article to H. He will take care to ensure that it will appear without the title of Docent; the bad mood doesn't remain. \?{But now nothing is likely to come of the reporting out of Munich for the N.N.}{Aber mit den Berichten aus M체nchenl}, and Paris was out lf the question. I feel like a Robinson, seeing his ship in the ocean, hoping it approaches -- and hoping in vain. \?{Munich appears to me as sad as an island of castaways}{M체nchen erscheint mir so traurig wie eine Insel der Schiffbr체chigen}. --

As I was in the cafe reading about the massive entry of troops into Berlin and of Molkembuhr's advance against the "White Guards", I was struck by the impression: the generals -- there are now 6 in Berlin, \?{4 of them noble}{davon 4 adlige} -- will soon shove aside the commander-in-chief Noske. Then as the telegram about the hardly-legitimate deaths of Liebknechts and Rosa Luxemburg came, the impression was strengthened: the present government will be crushed between the collision of the despair from the left and embitterment from the right. Forebodings of a military dictatorship. --
