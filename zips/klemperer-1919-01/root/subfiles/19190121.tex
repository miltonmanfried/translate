Fraulein Buckel ans her youngling came to see us yesterday afternoon. \?{Her tiny voice only was only just barely audible in our house}{Ihr Stimmchen reicht nur eben gerade zum Hausgebrauch}; incomprehensible how she can think of giving concerts -- but she will marry her Mecklenburg farmer and have children. -- \missing. This morning a major catastrophe with E, since I blamed her organ playing for my too-short stay in Munich. That closed with a long confrontation, whether she should remain here until Easter or should come with me to Munich. Conclusion: we travel Wedneaday, 28/I, together. Beforehand I go to Berlin. Lerch wrote me today that my lectures could begin on Thursday, 6/II. My conscience is very troubled about Eva. At the same time also sorely depressed otherwise.

Lecture: Schneegans, Moli√®re.
