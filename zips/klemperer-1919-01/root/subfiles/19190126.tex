\header{Sunday 1/2 3 26/January 19.}

A nonsensical decision on the electoral franchise made us, who are neither Saxon nor Leipzigers, nor hardly locals, electors for the local city council. We had just gone to the same pub as last Sunday for the national election, and voted the same way for the Democratic list. To some extent out of gratitude to Leipzig, which one would like to protect from the Independents. -- \missing
