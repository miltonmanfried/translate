\header{Monday evening towards 10 o'clock. 3 February.}

Skipped breakfast and lunch to write at home. Eva meanwhile passed an exam from Becht...Cafe Glasl and the working room at the university library. Friendly meeting with Lerch. He gave me professor Behren's address in Giessen, who edits some Romance language journal; I am to inquire there about a recension of a Voltaire book. \?{I did that as well}{Das tat ich gleich}...I was allocated a place on the long-desired professor side of the work room, distinguished by a bookshelf in front of your seat. I finished the first lecture (Introduction and D'Aubigné); it is a combination of Lotheissen,zLanson, Sainte-Beuve \?{and it is going difficultly for me}{und fällt mir doch schwer}. -- To supper (Old Pinakothek) with Eva, who has meanwhile visited Klose, her future theory teacher, to Glasl and home early, out of the frost and snow into the warmth. Prolonged deep depression and \WTF{inabiloty to eat}{ungenießbar}. Money troubles and all possible bitterness and loneliness. I may not go to Hans M's, his Spartakist bosom buddy Weckerle has put me off.
