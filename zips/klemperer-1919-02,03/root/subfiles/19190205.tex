\header{Wednesday evening 11 o'clock 5/II.}

Lecture preparations. D'Urfé still not ready. I.e., I have enough material for $1\frac{1}{2}$ hours. Morning at home, afternoon in the working room. Eva looked for an apartment, found a pension which then turned out to be too expensive. More irritation about that, with tension om both sides...after waring with Hans, violent fruitless debate about Wekerle and radicalism. H is far to the left, sees the canaille through rose-tinted glasses. At 8:30 we met \textit{Lerch} at Glasl. Grumbled about the pitiful \?{faculty ratios}{Dozentenverhältnisse}. Lerch seems to have been gotten over the death of his wife, but has become a malcontent. He complains -- incidentallyl very wittily -- about everything and everybody. It humiliates me to have to seek advice and support from him in everything related to my career. He says that I take my lecturing duty too seriously.
