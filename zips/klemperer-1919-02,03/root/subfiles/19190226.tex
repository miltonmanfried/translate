\header{Wednesday eveninv 26/II. 19.}

The madness here goes further. Letters with "false" reports to "foreign lands" are controlled -- so my column will probably be held up...This morning, ringing of bells, black and red flags and wanton (\?{celebratory}{Gaudi-}) shots for Eisner's funeral. Hans M -- after eating at his place -- beamed over the victory of the proletariat and smiled pityingly at my outrage over all the nonsense and oppression (hostages!). Wekerle constantly with a fanatical facial expression, always around him. I would not go there any more if not for multifaceted egoism (to obtain news and provisions, to sell the coat, \?{in the worst case to cover myself}{im schlimmsten Fall eine RÃ¼ckendeckung zu haben}). He has become totally foreign to me.
