\header{Sunday towards 7:30, March 2 19.}

Eva is seriously sick with the flu, laid out for the whole day. The fever has reached $39\deg$, after eating I will summon Dr Ritter for her. I am not unconcerned.

I also sat the whole day at home and read \textit{Pompée}. Vossler was completely right in his course in Winter 12/13: \WTF{a sinking piece. But there are good people in it}{"ein sinkendes Stück". Aber es sind Menschen darin.}

I was only at the door once: when a flyer was dropped off. It called for resistance against the communists and was signed by all of the local \?{troop detachments}{Truppenteilen}. It however also, quite unclearly, entreated for the U.S.P. Yesterday afternoon there are said to have been fliers from Nuremberg calling the Majority Socialists here to resistance. That means outside troops are heading our way. Very strange how, with the press gagged, fliers now convey the news. --

Lerch was here in the afternoon, but knew nothing new. --

Most of the time Eva lay here on the sofa, but undressed in the bedspread, half-asleep. 

In the evening, one could hear heavy distant shooting, hand grenades and machineguns.
