\header{Monday morning, 7 o'clock. 10/March 19.}

On Sunday evening things again went frightfully bad for Eva: restlessness, moaning, ceying -- I was glad when the doctor got here at 12 and got her to bed after much sweating and \?{getting in and out of bed}{Umbetten} and codeine and words of comfort. After that Sunday was again quite good -- we remained over the hill. Then again the night through to today punctuated by pains and restlessness, I gave her codeine at 2:30 and 6, tucked Eva into bed over here and \?{also readied myself}{machte mich auch gleich fertig}. It is said to be one and the same wandering infection in Eva that causes the intermittent fever and which will soon torment her feet, soon the hands and always in the joints and the neck-glands, and which threatens the heart. Antidote: in the first place, salicylic acid, a cut will probably have to be made in the neck. The matter gradually takes me along as well. -- \missing
