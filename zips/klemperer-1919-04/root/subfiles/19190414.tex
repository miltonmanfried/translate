\header{Monday morning April 14th 19.}

Yesterday morning I began work on the Voltaire referat, in the afternoon much reading aloud (Zola), we were also at Meyerhof's and the Stephanie. Music here in the evening. (Frau Dr Sobat and Ritter). Throughout, the political situation was a pleasant thrill. At noon there was a sign: The Raterepublik will be dismissed this evening. \?{The garrison advises the Hoffman government of their status}{Die Garnison ber√§t ihre Stellung zur Regierung Hoffmann}. Later in the afternoon the shooting started; between 8 and 10 in the evening it cracked loudly, also hand grenades, perhaps even cannon shots. Then it became silent. No trams ran today e non si sa niente.  But through it all I am no longer emotionally affected. I only think to myself: better a bloody decisive confrontation than half-measures. I now here more and more often: it's all the same whether the present Raterepublik government in Munich holds out or not -- the German Raterepublik is now unstoppable. \?{I hear it at the university, and from the waiter in the Stephanie}{So Strich in der Univ, so der Kellner im Stephanie}. And the endless unrest constantly flaring up at new points of course also makes me very suspicious.

Of my report that I sent to Leipzig on Wednesday evening, the first half is in the Friday morning issue, which remarkably was laid out on Sunday afternoon in the work room at the university. The post is now completely unpredictable.
