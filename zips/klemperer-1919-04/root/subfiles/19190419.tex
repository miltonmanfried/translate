\header{Saturday morning 19/4}

Yesterday the whole afternoon in the justice palace. Frightful  bitterness of the public. Finally at 5 \WTF{a compromise is heard}{eine Verhandlung gehört}. The second, which shall appear in my "revolutionary diary" was recounted to me by Heilbronn, who was also there. -- In the evening at Hans M's, who sold me smoked meat and bonbons for 80M. Wekerle was there, reporting the news from Landauer. The mood suddenly changed. He is now to enter \textit{this} government: \?{which still hangs on and is said to be spreading}{die sich doch halten}. I will report this in a second diary entry. I sent the first out from here today. We spoke at length about the university reform. I have the impression of \WTF{ever-greater extravagance}{allzu großer}, with very many good ideas. If I am to be downgraded to a "Teacher at the Munich Volkshochschule" here, \?{I would prefer to leave}{gehe ich lieber}. -- I finished reading the "\textit{bête humaine}" aloud. \WTF{Many weaknesses, overly long}{Manche Schwäche, gewaltige Größe}. -- No Corneille, no lecture preparations, a weight on my soul.

For a long, long time no post, no newpaper. Today at noon the trains are said to run again.
