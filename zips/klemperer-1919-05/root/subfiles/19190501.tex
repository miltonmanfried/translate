\header{May 1st 19 Thursday morning}

Yesterday was the decisive moment. General strike. \WTF{Statement of the lies of the federation}{Angabe der Verbandslüge}[?], \WTF{whites defending the walls against the "Berlin-guards Cavalry Division at Munich's door}{weißer Maueranschlag gegen die "Berliner Garde-Schtzen-Cavall.-Div. vor den Thoren Münchens"}, constant distant artillery fire; it is said the the "enemy" is at the Eastern station. In the evening, Cafe closed at 9 o'clock, we went since we weren't tired -- cannon shots. Attack expected this morning. Instead, silence and May Day celebrations. We got excited for nothing. We have had a Räterepublik since April 7th, chaos and total blockade since the 14th.

Very bad cold weather, snow, hail, rain. Continual heating is necessary.
