Yesterday afternoon I wanted to visit Hans M in the hospital on Hermann Schmidtstrasse at Lindwurmstrasse by the Sendlinger Gate blockade. I saw the whole battlefield. I have put this down in my further pages for Harms, which incidentally I do not believe will be printed. They have too much material; my letter from the 30th and 2nd is also still here: the post office is still closed. Yesterday Eva was not at her post, so I read some Zola aloud. I did almost nothing for the lecture and I am very frightened about it. -- In the evening Heilbronn's friend from school, Reyersbach, likewise a twenty-something from Hamburg, showed many very gifted drawings. It still always depresses me to be surrounded my so much more productive gifted people. My tiny aesthetics and journalism is so miserable next to it.

-- I wrote a letter to the old Meyerhofs, a card to mother, but still could send nothing out. Soon it shall have been a month of this isolation. --
